RESENTATIONS, PROCESSES, MEMORY MECHANISMS: THE BASIC COMPONENTS OFCOGNITION.EVERY COGNITIVE SKILL DRAWS UPON PART OF THE BRAIN'S EXTENSIVE REPERTOIRE OFREPRESENTATIONAL SUBSYSTEMS, STORAGE MECHANISMS, AND PROCESSES. THIS TUTORIALARTICLE IS AN INTRODUCTION TO RESEARCH EXPLORING THESE BASIC COMPONENTS OFCOGNITIVE SKILL AND THEIR ORGANISATION. 4 AREAS OF RESEARCH ARE REVIEWED: THEPERCEPTION OF OBJECTS AND WORDS; THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SHORT- AND LONG-TERMMEMORY MECHANISMS; THE RETRIEVAL OF REMEMBERED EPISODES AND FACTS; ATTENTION,PERFORMANCE, AND CONSCIOUSNESS
