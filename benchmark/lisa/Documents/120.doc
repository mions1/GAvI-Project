A 1978 REPORTDEFINED MATERIAL BELONGING RESPECTIVELY TO LOCAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS AND LOCALHISTORY ARCHIVES, RECOMMENDING COORDINATION BY THE LIBRARY BUT CONSIDERABLEAUTONOMY FOR THE ARCHIVES.

PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THOUGH THE NATURAL HOME FOR LOCAL HISTORYARCHIVES, WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCE AND STAFFING.
