SUCH AN INVESTIGATION WORTHY OF KL?.     COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES(KOMMUNERNES LANDSFORENING (KL)) ON THE TRIAL RUN OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES'AUTOMATION SYSTEM, FAUST, IN OLSTYKKE LIBRARY. GIVES THE REASONS FOR THEFAILURE OF FAUST AS LACK OF PERCEIVED ECONOMIC RETURNS, OPPOSITION OF THELIBRARIANS' UNION ON THE GROUNDS OF STAFF REDUCTIONS, AND SIZE OF INITIALINVESTMENTS. THE FEW LIBRARIANS WHO POINTED TO IMPROVED SERVICE AND LONG-TERMECONOMIC BENEFITS WERE OVERRULED. BIBLIOTEKSDATA, WHICH REPLACED FAUST IN1978, IS MORE DECENTRALISED, WITH SERVICES TAILOR-MADE TO INDIVIDUALLIBRARIES' NEEDS. ARGUES THAT KL IN ITS REPORT DISMISSES THE VALUE OF THETRIAL RUN AND THE STAFF'S VIEWS OF THE EXPERIMENT, WHICH STRESS THELABOUR-SAVING EFFECTS OF THE AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEM. CALLS FOR CENTRALREGISTRATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES' STOCK IN THE COMMON DATA BASE BY THE LIBRARYCENTRE; THEN THE INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY CAN BEGIN REGISTRATION OF ITS OWN STO CKAND START USING AUTOMATED ISSUE CONTROL WITH ENSUING IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICEAND LABOUR ECONOMIES
