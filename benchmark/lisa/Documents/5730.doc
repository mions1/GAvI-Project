 NATIONAL LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION AND ASSOCIATION CREDIBILITY.CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL FEATURE ON THE FUTURE OF ASSOCIATIONS. NLA WASFOUNDED IN 1975 TO MEET A LONG-FELT NEED IN MANY LIBRARIANS FOR A NATIONALPROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION WHICH WOULD CONCERN ITSELF EXCLUSIVELY WITH LIBRARIANISSUES RATHER THAN WITH THE ENTIRE GAMUT OF ISSUES RELATED TO LIBRARIES INSOCIETY. NLA IS SMALL, NEW AND NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE USA HAS 100,000LIBRARIANS, BUT NLA HAS ONLY 500 MEMBERS. NO LIBRARY PUBLICATION HAS REPORTEDON OR EVALUATED NLA'S POSITION PAPERS ON A NATIONWIDE SYSTEM OF CERTIFICATIONFOR LIBRARIANS AND ON PROFESSIONAL WELFARE. LIBRARY SCHOOLS TEND TO IGNORENLA'S OFFERS TO PROVIDE SPEAKERS OR INFORMATION MATERIALS. IN MANY WAYS NLAHAS ACHIEVED A GREAT DEAL, BUT IT STANDS AT A CRITICAL POINT IN ITSDEVELOPMENT. IT MAY BE THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSING 'BREAD AND BUTTER' ISSUES WILLPROVIDE THE IMPETUS NLA NEEDS TO REGAIN ITS MOVEMENT TOWARD BECOMING A MAJORNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR LIBRARIA NS
