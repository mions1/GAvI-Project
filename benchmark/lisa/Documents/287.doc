PUTER PERCEPTION OF TOPOLOGICAL SYMMETRY VIA CANONICAL NUMBERING OF ATOMS.AN ALGORITHM FOR PERCEPTION OF TOPOLOGICAL SYMMETRY HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED FORCOMPUTER USE. THE ALGORITHM IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF THE SMALLEST BINARYCODE FOR A GRAPH AND REQUIRES GENERATION OF ALL NUMBERINGS FOR A STRUCTUREWHICH WILL PRODUCE THE CANONICAL FORM FOR THE ADJACENCY MATRIX. THE UNIQUEADJACENCY MATRIX CORRESPONDS TO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE (BINARY) NUMBERREPRESENTING THE STRUCTURE WHEN ITS ROWS ARE READ FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND FROMLEFT TO RIGHT. OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM IS ILLUSTRATED WITH A SELECTION OFPOLYCYCLIC STRUCTURES
