WHEN YISRAELI ARRIVED IN KFAR GIL'ADI IN 1934 HE FOUND ABOUT 250BOOKS. TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE HE VOLUNTARILY ORGANISED THE COLLECTION ANDENHANCED IT SO THAT IN 1938 IT CONTAINED 10,000 VOLUMES AND BECAME ANIMPORTANT INSTITUTION IN THE CULTURAL LIFE OF THE KIBBUTZ MEMBERS. TODAY THELIBRARY IS NO LONGER A CULTURAL CENTRE AND THE COLLECTION DOES NOT MEET THENEEDS OF THE MEMBERS.
