RTICULAR PROBLEMS IN THE TRAINING OF HIGHER-QUALIFIED LIBRARY AND RESEARCHSTAFF.     MANY LIBRARY SCHOOLS SUFFER FROM HAVING TOO FEW QUALIFIED LECTURERS,OVER-LOADED AND ILL-PLANNED SYLLABUSES, AND FROM PAYING TOO LITTLE ATTENTIONTO POST-GRADUATE WORK. UNTIL THESE FAULTS ARE REMEDIED THERE IS LITTLE HOPE OFIMPROVING SIGNIFICANTLY THE FURTHER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS. THERE IS A NEEDFOR A MORE GENERAL SYLLABUS, SO THAT STUDENTS EMERGE WITH DETAILED KNOWLEDGEOF A WIDE RANGE OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. POST-GRADUATE STUDENTS NEED TO BE MORECAREFULLY SELECTED AND THEIR DISSERTATIONS MORE CLOSELY SUPERVISED
