UCING BLOCK ACCESSES IN INVERTED FILES BY PARTIAL CLUSTERING.     THE RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION FROM AN INVERTED FILE REQUIRES ACCESS TO BOTHINDEX AND DATA BLOCKS. HEURISTIC TECHNIQUES TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DATA BLOCKACCESSES ARE PRESENTED, AND CAN BE REORGANISED CONCURRENTLY WITH NORMAL USERACTIVITIES. PREVIOUS WORK ON INTERRELATED RECORD CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES ISDESCRIBED. METHODS FOR THE PARTIAL REORGANISATION OF DATA FILES ARE DESCRIBEDAND COMPARED WITH THE TOTAL SORT METHOD, USING AN ARTIFICIAL RANDOMLYGENERATED FILE. METHODS DESCRIBED ARE SORTING IN ORDER OF THE CATENATED KEYFORMED FROM THE ATTIBUTES, REORDERING A SET OF ADJACENT BLOCKS, AND THE LOCALOPTIMUM, PARTIAL SORT AND CARE METHODS FOR SELECTING THE CLUSTER; SORTING GAVETHE BEST RESULTS, BUT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR ON-LINE REORGANISATION. PARTIALMETHODS FAVOUR AN INCREASE IN THE BUFFER SIZE, AND THE DISTANCE FUNCTION ISMORE EFFECTIVE FOR SELECTING A CLUSTER, WHERE THE ATTRIBUTES HAVE MANY VALUES
