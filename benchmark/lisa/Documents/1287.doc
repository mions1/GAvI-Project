ORY OF CORRELATION TABLES. 2.A PROCESS HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR THE OPTIMISATION OF SPECTROSCOPICAL CORRELATIONTABLES CONTAINING COMPLEX PRIMARY AND SUBFRAGMENTS. THE METHOD IS BASED ONINFORMATION THEORY AND PROVIDES THE QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE USEFULNESSOF ANY CHANGE WITHIN A GIVEN CORRELATION TABLE. IN THIS WAY, FOR EXAMPLE, ITSHOWS IN WHICH CASE IT IS EXPEDIENT TO SPECIALISE A FRAGMENT AND ALSO WHEN ITIS WORTH DRAWING TOGETHER SEVERAL SUBFRAGMENTS INTO ONE FRAGMENT. THE PROCESSCAN EASILY BE EXPRESSED AS A COMPUTER ALGORITHM, AND IN THIS WAY IT CAN BEUSEFUL FOR A SET OF COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS FOR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS
