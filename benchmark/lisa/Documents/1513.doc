E TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT: AN ATTEMPT AT 'ILLUMINATIVE EVALUATION'.     CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE ON THE APPLICATION OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO THESTUDY OF INFORMATION PROBLEMS. AN ACCOUNT OF THE BACKGROUND AGAINST WHICH ANON-TRADITIONAL STRATEGY OF EVALUATION WAS ADOPTED IN NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNEPOLYTECHNIC'S TRAVELLING WORKSHOPS EXPERIMENT (SEE 77/3731).
