BRARY EDUCATION AND THE NEED FOR COORDINATION (IN ARABIC).THE JORDAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION HAS SUPPLIED JORDANIAN LIBRARIES WITH TRAINEDSTAFF SINCE ITS LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES BEGAN IN 1964, AND THE LIBRARY ANDINFORMATION CENTRE WAS LATER ESTABLISHED TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THISFIELD. SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY EDUCATION IS HAMPERED BY EXCESSIVE INTEREST INFINANCIAL CONCERNS AND LACK OF PROPER PLANNING. CONTENDS THAT' ACADEMICQUALIFICATIONS AND FIELD EXPERIENCE OF INSTRUCTORS SHOULD BE STANDARDISED;INSTITUTIONS QUALIFIED TO TEACH LIBRARIANSHIP MUST BE DEFINED; THE REALLIBRARY NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; QUALITY MUST NOT BESACRIFICED TO OUTPUT OF GRADUATES; AND COORDINATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALINSTITUTIONS AND THE JLA WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS
