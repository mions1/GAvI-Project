ME PROBLEMS WITH PART-TIME COURSES IN LIBRARIANSHIP.     IN ADDITION TO FULLTIME COURSES OFFERED BY THE SCHOOL OF LIBRARIANSHIP INSOFIA, PART-TIME COURSES, I.E. IN-SERVICE COURSES, HELP TO INCREASE THE NUMBEROF QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS. FROM 1960 TO 1976, 936 PART-TIME STUDENTS ENROLLED,AND 834, I.E. 89%, COMPLETED THEIR STUDIES INCLUDING 16 STUDENTS FROM THECYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY. 99% OF THE STUDENTS WERE WOMEN, WHO WEREFORCED FREQUENTLY TO EXTEND THEIR STUDIES BEYOND 3 YEARS BECAUSE OF MATERNITYLEAVE, ILLNESS AND OTHER REASONS. IN FUTURE, THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES, INPARTICULAR, MUST HELP TO SELECT SUITABLE CANDIDATES AS PROSPECTIVE PART-TIMESTUDENTS. LIBRARIES ALSO HAVE A DUTY TO INTENSIFY THEIR ASSISTANCE TO ENROLLEDPART-TIME STUDENTS, PROVIDE HELP DURING THE COURSE AS WELL AS TO ASSIST THOSESTUDENTS WHO ARE PREPARING FOR FINAL EXAMINATIONS AND THESES. ONLY THEN CANPART-TIME COURSES GRADUALLY BECOME AN EQUIVALENT TO FULLTIME STUDY
