LINE FORECASTING CAPABILITIES' FUTURSCAN AND ITS ALTERNATIVES.PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE FIELD OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMSWHOSE DATA BASES ARE PROGRAMMED TO PREDICT FUTURE EVENTS. THESE SYSTEMS RELYON DATA OF PAST EVENTS AND USE MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES SUCH AS REGRESSIONANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL PROBABILITY TO PROVIDE FORECAST DATA. THE HISTORY OFTHESE SYSTEMS IS TRACED THROUGH THE ADVENT OF THE IBM QUICKTRAN PROGRAM IN1967 AND DESCRIPTIONS OF 13 OTHER PREDICTIVE SYSTEMS. RECENT TREND IMPACTANALYSIS STUDIES HAVE LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERAX AND FUTURSCAN, WHICHOFFER SOPHISTICATED AND COMPLEX PREDICTIVE ON-LINE CAPABILITIES. REPORT NOTAVAILABLE FROM NTIS
