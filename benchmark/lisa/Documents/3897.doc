ORITHMIC GENERATION OF CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS INDEX NAMES. 1. GENERAL DESIGN.     THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) CHEMICAL REGISTRY SYSTEM IS ACOMPUTER-BASED CHEMICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM THAT UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES CHEMICALSUBSTANCES ON THE BASIS OF THEIR MOLECULAR STRUCTURE. AN ALGORITHM HAS BEENDEVELOPED FOR COMPUTER GENERATION OF CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS (CA) INDEX NAMES FORORGANIC COMPOUNDS FROM REGISTRY STRUCTURE RECORDS. WHEN PROGRAMMED ANDINSTALLED IN THE CAS PRODUCTION SYSTEM, THE ALGORITHM WILL SUPPORT CA INDEXPREPARATION BY GENERATING NAMES FOR A MAJORITY OF THE APPROXIMATELY 1400 NEWSTRUCTURES PROCESSED PER WORKING DAY AT CAS
