EARCH TECHNOLOGY' A STUDY OF THE SPREAD OF SPECTRAL METHODS BY ANALYSINGPUBLICATIONS.     SHOWS HOW AN ANALYSIS OF PARALLEL SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES CANINDICATE THE DYNAMICS OF THE SPREAD OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS, THELEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT, AND THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENCE IN THOSECOUNTRIES. USES THIS METHOD TO STUDY THE DYNAMICS OF THE SPREAD OF INFRAREDAND NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY AND MASS SPECTROMETRY IN THE UK,USA, FRANCE, AND WEST GERMANY DURING 1960-77. ARTICLES IN 2JOURNAL OF ORGANICCHEMISTRY1 AND 2JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY1 ARE COMPARED TOEVALUATE THE SPEED OF SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS TRANSFER FROM FUNDAMENTAL TOAPPLIED SCIENCE AND THE RATIO OF METHODS USED IN THE LATTER DISCIPLINE
