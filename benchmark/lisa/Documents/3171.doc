IAL COST EFFICIENCY-A MODEL AND CASE STUDY (IN HEBREW).     HIGH RATE INFLATION IN PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION PRICES WITHOUT ADEQUATE BUDGETINCREMENTS FORCE MANY LIBRARIES TO FREEZE NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS AND IN MANY CASESTO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS. THE PROCESS OF DESELECTION RAISES THE QUESTION OFWHICH TITLES WILL BE RETAINED AND WHICH WILL BE DISCONTINUED. SUGGESTS THATTHE EVALUATION OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIOUS TITLES WILL BE DONEBY USING A COST EFFICIENCY FORMULA. THE FORMULA COMBINES 2 FACTORS, THE PRICEOF SUBSCRIPTION AND THE MEASURED USE OF THE JOURNAL, AND RANKS PERIODICALS INA GIVEN COLLECTION IN A DESCENDING ORDER' AT THE TOP WILL BE THE MOSTCOST-EFFICIENT TITLE AND AT THE BOTTOM THE LEAST COST-EFFICIENT TITLE. THISFORMULA WAS TRIED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A USE STUDY OF THE JUDAICA READINGROOM'S OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES DURING 1978
