LYSIS AND CODING OF GENERIC CHEMICAL FORMULAE IN CHEMICAL PATENTS.PRESENTS A FORMAL LINGUISTIC APPROACH TO THE REPRESENTATION OF GENERICCHEMICAL FORMULAE IN CHEMICAL PATENTS, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF USE OF THE ALWINLINE-FORMULA NOTATION (AN ALGORITHMIC VERSION OF THE WISWESSER LINE NOTATION).THE OBJECTIVE OF THE REPRESENTATION IS TO PERMIT SEARCHES FOR SPECIFICSTRUCTURES AND FOR SUBSTRUCTURES WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE GENERICEXPRESSION. THE RELEVANCE OF PATTERN ANALYSIS METHODS TO THIS PROBLEM ISHIGHLIGHTED AND PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS ON ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT ARE PUTFORWARD
