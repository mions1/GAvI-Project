THE INCLUSIVENESS OF SYSTEMS FOR RETRIEVAL DOCUMENTS INDEXED BY UNWEIGHTEDDESCRIPTORS.     ONE MEANS OF REDUCING INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TIME IS BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEPROPERTY OF INCLUSIVENESS OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. WHEN ONE KNOWS THESYSTEM RESPONSE TO A QUERY WHICH IS MORE GENERAL IN RELATION TO ANOTHER QUERY,THEN IN AN INCLUSIVE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO RETRIEVE THE RESPONSE TO THEMORE SPECIFIC QUERY IT SUFFICES TO LIMIT THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROCESS TOTHE SEARCH OF THE SYSTEM RESPONSE TO THE MORE GENERAL QUERY. DEMONSTRATES THEPROPERTY OF INCLUSIVENESS OF DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WHERE DOCUMENTS AREINDEXED BY UNWEIGHTED DESCRIPTORS, AND IN WHICH QUERY SEARCH PATTERNS AREBOOLEAN FUNCTIONS OF DESCRIPTORS (SYSTEMS USING THE INVERTED FILE METHOD, THECANONICAL STRUCTURE FILE-METHOD, OR THE SEQUENTIAL FILE METHOD). THE PAPERPRESENTS 3 METHODS FOR A DETERMINING A PARTIAL ORDERING RELATION ON A SET OFBOOLEAN SEARCH PATTERNS OF QUERIES, IMPLYING A PARTIAL ORDERI NG ON THE SET OFTHE SYSTEM RESPONSES TO THESE QUERIES AND DISCUSSES THE ADEQUACY OF EACHMETHOD DEPENDING ON THE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL METHOD USED
