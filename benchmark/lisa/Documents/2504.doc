NLINE MICROFILM RECORDERS AT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY.     THE LOS ALAMOS COMPUTING DIVISION HAS DEVELOPED A SATELLITE GRAPHICS OUTPUTSTATION (PAGES). THIS STATION ACCEPTS USER REQUESTS FOR OUTPUT THROUGH A LARGECOMPUTER NETWORK (THE ICN). THE SYSTEM TRANSLATES A STANDARD METAFILE INTO ADEVICE-SPECIFIC FORMAT AND EFFICIENTLY GENERATES THE REQUESTED OUTPUT. AT THESAME TIME, PAGES PROVIDES SOME GRAPHICS PROCESSING, PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED BY THELARGE SUPERCOMPUTERS
