T'S THAT FUNNY NOISE?' VIDEOGAMES IN THE LIBRARY.A YEAR AGO, FLESH PUBLIC LIBRARY, PIQUA, OHIO, INTRODUCED AN ELECTRONICLEARNING CENTRE TO INTRODUCE THE 25,000-STRONG PREDOMINANTLY RURAL COMMUNITYTO THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE CENTRE CONTAINS A PUBLIC MICROCOMPUTER, VIDEOTAPEAND CAMERA SERVICES, AND A VIDEOGAME CONSOLE WITH 17 GAME CARTRIDGES. THEVIDEOGAMES HAVE ATTRACTED MANY YOUNG IRREGULAR LIBRARY USERS WHO MAY, IN TIME,EXTEND THEIR ATTENTION TO OTHER LIBRARY FACILITIES. THE COST OF ESTABLISHINGAND MAINTAINING THE VIDEOGAME AREA HAS BEEN REASONABLE AND PROBLEMS OFDISCIPLINE, NOISE, AND SUPERVISION HAVE BEEN MINIMAL DUE TO CAREFUL PLANNING.NO CHARGE IS MADE FOR PLAYING THE GAMES
