RACTERISTICS OF MICROS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS.     IN RECENT YEARS, THE MARKET IN MICROCOMPUTERS HAS MUSHROOMED MAKING SUCHSYSTEMS AVAILABLE AT PRICES FROM UNDER *6100-*610,000'S, RIVALLING THEFACILITIES AND POWER OF MINICOMPUTERS OR EVEN SMALL MAINFRAMES. GIVES A BRIEFHISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MICROCOMPUTERS AND DESCRIBES THE VARIOUSCOMPONENTS OF SUCH A SYSTEM. PAYS PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE TYPE OFCOMPONENT THAT IS LIKELY TO BE AVAILABLE IN SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS'SMALL BUSINESS SYSTEMS' AND INVESTIGATES THE APPLICATIONS OF SUCH SYSTEMS.DESPITE THE VAST MARKET IN MICROCOMPUTERS, THERE ARE STILL MANY RESTRICTIONSWHICH MAY PREVENT THEIR BEING USED IN SOME APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS THE CAPACITYOF THE PRIMARY MEMORY. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE VERY FEW STANDARDS IN THE AREAOF MICROCOMPUTERS, LEADING TO PROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY BOTH FROM THE HARDWAREAND SOFTWARE VIEWPOINT. SUCH PROBLEMS ARE BEING OVERCOME AT PRESENT BUT IT ISLIKELY THAT THEY WILL PERSIST FOR SOME TIME TO  COME AS THE PRESSURES OFMARKETING CANNOT WAIT FOR STANDARDS TO BE DEVELOPED. THE RESTRICTIONS OFMICROCOMPUTERS ARE ALSO BEING OVERCOME, PARTICULARLY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF16-BIT (AND EVEN 32-BIT) PROCESSORS AND MORE SOPHISTICATED METHODS OF STORAGE,SUCH AS 'BUBBLE MEMORIES'. EXAMINES SUCH DEVELOPMENTS AND BRIEFLY CONTRASTSDEVELOPMENTS IN HARDWARE WITH THOSE IN SOFTWARE
