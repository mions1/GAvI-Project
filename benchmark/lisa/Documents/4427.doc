OMATION OF TEST-DATA TRANSMISSION FROM PRODUCER TO COMPUTER MASTER FILE.     DESCRIBES 2 METHODS FOR THE DIRECT INPUT OF DATA OBTAINED DURING SCIENTIFICEXPERIMENTS INTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL, ALL FURTHER DATA MANIPULATION ANDPROCESSING BEING CONTROLLED BY COMPUTER PROGRAMS' (1) DIRECT RECORDING OFOBSERVATIONS (E.G. PLANT GROWTH) ON A PORTABLE BATTERY-POWERED RECORDINGDEVICE, FOLLOWED BY DATA TRANSMISSION TO THE COMPUTER AND (2) CRT ENTRY OFOBSERVED VALUES FOR TEST AND CONTROL ANIMALS FOR SPECIFIC TESTS. ONLY AFTERVERIFICATION OF DATA ACCURACY BY THE INFORMATION PRODUCER ARE THE RESULTSENTERED INTO THE MASTER DATA BASE. IN THE EXPERIMENTS DESCRIBED, THE ABBOTTAUTOMATED BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA SYSTEM (ABCD) WAS USED
