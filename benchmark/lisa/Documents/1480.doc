THE AVAILABILITY OF THEARCHIVED FILE HAS PROMPTED US TO INVESTIGATE WAYS IN WHICH IT MAY BEADVANTAGEOUSLY UTILISED IN THE FUTURE. DESCRIBES ONE ASPECT OF THISINVESTIGATION INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF AN EXPERIMENTAL ON-LINEPROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS AN OPERATOR TO SELECT TEXTUAL SUBSETS OF PRIMARYDOCUMENTS. THE PREPARATION OF ARTICLES FOR A SYNOPTIC JOURNAL IS ONE POSSIBLEFUTURE APPLICATION OF THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM.
