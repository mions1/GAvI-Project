CE UTILIZATION AND ACCESS PATH LENGTH IN B-TREES.     B-TREES (BALANCED TREES) ARE USED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF VERY LARGE INDEXES. ASTATE VECTOR AND SYSTEM OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS DESCRIBING THE BEHAVIOUR OFSTATE CHANGES, FORM A DETERMINISTIC MODEL OF THE STATIC PROPERTIES. A UNIFORMDISTRIBUTION OF KEYS IS ASSUMED. STATIC PROPERTIES, OPERATIONS ON B-TREES, ANDOVERFLOW AND UNDERFLOW TREATMENT ARE DEFINED. A BASIC MODEL OF B-TREES IS USEDTO MODEL SPACE UTILISATION AND PATH LENGTH WHICH IS THEN APPLIED TO THETREATMENT OF UNDERFLOW AND OVERFLOW IN B-TREE ORGANISATION
