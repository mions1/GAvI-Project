OLOGICAL CENTRIC CODING AND NOMENCLATURE OF POLYCYCLIC HYDROCARBONS. 1.CONDENSED BENZENOID SYSTEMS (POLYHEXES, FUSENES).     ON THE BASIS OF THE FOCAL NUMBERING OF EACH BENZENOID RING IN THE GRAPHITELATTICE, ANY POLYHEX (CATA-, PERI, AND CORONA-FUSED POLYCYCLIC BENZENOIDSYSTEM) CAN BE CODED BY MAKING USE OF (1) THE DUALIST GRAPH OF THE POLYHEX AND(2) THE RECENT GENERALISATION OF THE TOPOLOGICAL CENTRE CONCEPT. THE NUMERICALCODE CAN BE USED FOR NOMENCLATURE PURPOSES, AND THE PRESENT APPROACH CAN BEEASILY GENERALISED TO CONDENSED NONBENZENOID SYSTEMS AS WILL BE SHOWN INFUTURE PUBLICATIONS
