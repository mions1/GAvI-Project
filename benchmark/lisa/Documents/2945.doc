BLEM OF RETRIEVAL FILE STRUCTURE OPTIMISATION ACCORDING TO RETRIEVAL TIMECRITERION.     WHEN DEVELOPING ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, THE SPEED OF RESPONSE TO INQUIRIESIS ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM'S QUALITY. CONSIDERS ACOMPONENT OF RESPONSE TIME-THE DESCRIPTOR RETRIEVAL TIME. DISCUSSES DIRECT,INVERSE, AND COMBINED PATTERNS OF FILE ORGANISATION, MAKES A COMPARATIVEANALYSIS, AND EVALUATES DESCRIPTOR RETRIEVAL TIME FOR EACH. PROPOSES APROBABILITY MODEL OF RETRIEVAL IN A COMBINED FILE. ON THE BASIS OF THIS MODEL,THE PROBLEM OF OPTIMISING A COMBINED FILE ACCORDING TO THE TIME CRITERION ISSOLVED
