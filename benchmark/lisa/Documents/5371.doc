OMPARISON OF TWO SYSTEMS OF WEIGHTED BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.A MAJOR DEFICIENCY OF TRADITIONAL BOOLEAN SYSTEMS IS THEIR INABILITY TOREPRESENT THE VARYING DEGREES TO WHICH A DOCUMENT MAY BE WRITTEN ON A SUBJECT.IN THIS ARTICLE A NUMBER OF CRITERIA THAT SHOULD BE MET BY ANY BOOLEAN SYSTEMGENERALISED TO HAVE A WEIGHTING CAPABILITY ARE ISOLATED. IT IS PROVEN THATONLY 1 WEIGHTING RULE SATISFIES THESE CONDITIONS; THAT ASSOCIATED WITHFUZZY-SET THEORY; AND THAT THIS WEIGHTING SCHEME SATISFIES MOST OF THE OTHERPROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH BOOLEAN ALGEBRA AS WELL. PROBABILISTIC WEIGHTING ISTHEN INTRODUCED AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH AND THE 2 SYSTEMS COMPARED. IN THELIMIT OF ZERO/1 WEIGHTS, ALL SYSTEMS CONSIDERED CONVERGE TO TRADITIONALBOOLEAN RETRIEVAL
