 DANISH PUBLISHING WORLD ABROAD OR THE CHILDREN'S BOOK FAIR IN BOLOGNA 1981.     THE 1981 FAIR ILLUSTRATED THE MISERABLE NATURE OF PRESENT-DAY PUBLISHING BUTWAS A TRUE PICTURE OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, 80% OF WHICH CONSISTS OF COMICS,PICTURE-BOOKS AND COLOURED BOOKS, ALL IN POOR TASTE. CHILDREN'S BOOKS INGENERAL ARE AT A LOW LEVEL-THE TV SCREEN IN BOOK FORM-AND THE QUESTION ISWHETHER COLOURS AND PICTURES SELL WHEREAS CULTURE DOES NOT. SCANDINAVIAN BOOKPRODUCTION DIFFERS MARKEDLY FROM THAT OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN VARIETY, BREADTHAND WELL-DEFINED TASTE BUT IS IN AN OBVIOUSLY SCANDINAVIAN STYLE. THE 1981BOLOGNA FAIR WAS DULL, WITH LITTLE NEW OR OUTSTANDINGLY INTERESTING, ANDBUSINESS ALSO APPEARED TO BE POOR AND MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH JOINTBOOK-PRODUCTION IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. JOINT PRODUCTION ENABLES DANISHPUBLISHERS TO ISSUE QUALITY PICTURE BOOKS BUT ALSO HAS INCREASINGLY BECOME THEMEANS BY WHICH DANISH BOOKS CAN APPEAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
