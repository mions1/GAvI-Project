OLOGICAL BIAS AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IN BRAZIL.     PRESENTS THE CONCLUSIONS OF A PAPER GIVEN AT A BRAZILIAN SEMINAR ON LITERATUREFOR CHILDREN IN 1978. 21 CHILDREN'S BOOKS BY BRAZILIAN AUTHORS WERE EXAMINED,AND FOUND TO BE COMPOSED ACCORDING TO A RIGID PREDETERMINED STRUCTURE BASED ONA CLEAR AND ABSOLUTE DEMARCATION OF GOOD AND EVIL, BACKED BY AN IDEOLOGYLEGITIMISING THE POWER OF ADULTS OVER CHILDREN. DRAWS A PARALLEL WITH THESUBLITERATURE OF 19TH CENTURY FRANCE, AND POSTULATES THAT BRAZILIAN CHILDREN'SLITERATURE IS FUNDAMENTALLY A PRODUCT OF THE PREVAILING SOCIAL AND ECONOMICORDER, REFLECTING IN THE DEPICTION OF THE PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP THEPRODUCER-CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP OF INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY. THE INTRODUCTION OFSUPERFICIALLY CONTEMPORARY MATERIAL IN LANGUAGE AND PHYSICAL DETAIL DOES NOTAFFECT THE ESSENTIALLY REACTIONARY CHARACTER OF SUCH WORKS, AND THISIDEOLOGICAL RIGIDITY EXPLAINS THEIR LOW LITERARY QUALITY
