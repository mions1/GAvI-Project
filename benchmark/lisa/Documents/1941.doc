IMUM DESIGN OF TWO-COMPUTER NETWORKS.     2 IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IN DESIGNING COMPUTER NETWORKS ARE INVESTIGATED ANDSOLVED FOR 2-COMPUTER NETWORKS' ASSIGNMENT OF PROGRAMME MODULES AND DATA FILESTO THE DIFFERENT COMPUTERS IN THE NETWORK AND SELECTION OF CAPACITIES IN THENETWORK. THE INTERDEPENDENCES OF AN APPLICATION PROGRAMME'S MODULES AND FILESARE REPRESENTED, USING A GRAPH MODEL. A BRANCH-AND-BOUND ALGORITHM ISDEVELOPED TO MINIMISE PROGRAMME EXECUTION TIME. A 2ND, EARLIER-DEVELOPEDALGORITHM IS USED WITH THE 1ST ALGORITHM TO ALLOCATE A FIXED NUMBER OF DOLLARSAMONG THE NETWORK'S SUBSYSTEMS SUCH THAT THE PROGRAMME EXECUTION TIME IS AGAINMINIMISED. PRESENTS RESULTS OBTAINED BY USING THE ALGORITHMS WITHEXPERIMENTALLY-MEASURED DATA
