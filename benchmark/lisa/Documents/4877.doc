ESTIGATION OF SEARCH CODES (MATCHCODING) FOR CATALOGUE DATA.     DURING THE PLANNING FOR THE INCORPORATION OF DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES, THEDECISION-MAKING PROCESS IS AIDED THROUGH THE USE OF BASIC DATA. PRESENTS ANEVALUATION OF ABOUT 442,000 MACHINE-READABLE CATALOGUE ENTRIES FROM THEUNIVERSITY OF KONSTANZ LIBRARY. THE EFFECTIVENESS AND BEHAVIOUR OF VARIOUSSEARCH CODES (MATCHCODES) DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT DATA CATEGORIES WEREANALYSED CONCERNING THEIR PERFORMANCE WITHIN AN EXPANDING DATA BASE AND INJUXTAPOSITION WITH ONE ANOTHER. FURTHERMORE, THE FREQUENCY OF IDENTICAL DATAAND THEIR LENGTH WAS NOTED. RESULTS SHOWED THAT CLEAR DISTINCTIONS CAN BEATTAINED IF TYPES OF SEARCH CODES ARE ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC DATA GROUPS; STOPLIST SUPPORT IS, HOWEVER, NECESSARY FOR DYNAMIC MATCHCODES
