BLIC LIBRARY NEEDS FOR BLACKS' A PERSONAL VIEW.     IN SOUTH AFRICA IT OFTEN IS ALLEGED THAT BLACKS REQUIRE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TOOFFER SERVICES BY WHICH THEY CAN ADVANCE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND CAPABILITIES. ONTHE MASLOW PYRAMID THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED A NEED AT THE BASIC LEVEL, WHILETHE READING OF RECREATIVE WORKS COULD BE CONSIDERED TO LIE AT A HIGHER LEVEL.IN FACT IT IS FOUND THAT 72% OF BOOKS BORROWED BY BLACKS CONSIST OF FICTION.IT MAY NOW BE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY PASSED THEBASIC READING LEVEL, OR WHETHER RECREATIONAL READING FORMS PART OF THAT LEVEL.AS SOME 66% OF THE BLACK MEMBERSHIP OF A LIBRARY MAY CONSIST OF CHILDREN, THEHIGH PERCENTAGE OF FICTION CIRCULATED RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER THESECHILDREN SEE LIBRARIES PRIMARILY AS SOURCES OF INFORMATION, AND ABOUT THESUITABILITY OF NON-FICTION PROVIDED. ONLY ABOUT 5% OF BLACKS USE AVAILABLELIBRARY FACILITIES. IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE EDUCATIONAL APPROACHIS NOT BEING OVER-STRESSED IN BLACK PUBLIC LIBRARIES
