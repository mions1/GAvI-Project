NTITATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND NON-DESCRIPTORS IN THESAURI.ABOUT 40 THESAURI OR COLLECTIONS OF SUBJECT TERMINOLOGY EQUIVALENT TO THESAURIWERE STUDIED WITH REGARD TO QUANTITY RATIOS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS ANDNON-DESCRIPTORS OR BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND A TOTAL VOCABULARY. WITH THE HELPOF REGRESSION ANALYSIS, LINEAR CONNECTIONS WERE MADE WITH A STRONGLYEMPHASISED CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORS AND THENON-DESCRIPTORS. THEN THE NUMBER OF NON-DESCRIPTORS WAS FOUND TO INCREASE MORESLOWLY THAN THAT OF THE DESCRIPTORS, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PROPORTION OFNON-DESCRIPTORS TO THE TOTAL VOCABULARY DECREASES AS THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORSINCREASES. THE INIS THESAURUS (INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM) ISDESCRIBED IN RELATION TO THIS THEORY AND FOUND TO BE WELL PRODUCED
