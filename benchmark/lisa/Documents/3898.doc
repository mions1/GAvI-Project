PH POTENTIALS METHOD AND ITS APPLICATION FOR CHEMICAL INFORMATIONPROCESSING.     A GRAPH POTENTIALS METHOD FOR THE SOLUTION OF ISOMORPHISM AND AUTOMORPISMPARTITIONING PROBLEMS IS PROPOSED. THE METHOD IS BASED ON AN ANALOGY BETWEENGRAPHS AND ELECTRICAL NETWORKS AND SERVES TO COMPUTE GRAPH INVARIANTS,INCLUDING VERTEX POTENTIALS AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS AND TO PROVIDE ANEFFICIENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS. SOME COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATINGSENSITIVITY OF THE PROPOSED METHOD ARE PRESENTED
