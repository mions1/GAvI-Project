ATING MUTAGENICITY TO CHEMICAL STRUCTURE.A COMPUTER PROGRAM CORRELATING CHEMICAL STRUCTURE WITH MUTAGENESIS ACTIVITYHAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS A PREDICTIVE TEST FOR HAZARD EVALUATION. SETS OFSUBSTRUCTURAL UNITS ARE DERIVED FROM COMPLETE STRUCTURES, AND THE PROBABILITYTHAT A STRUCTURE CONTAINING A GIVEN UNIT WILL HAVE A DESIGNATED CATEGORY OFACTIVITY IS CALCULATED. THE PROGRAM, VALIDATED BY BACTERIAL MUTAGENESISTESTING, IS CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING SIMILAR STRUCTURES, SHOWING WHY THEY ARESIMILAR, AND ESTIMATING THE ACTIVITY OF A STRUCTURE
