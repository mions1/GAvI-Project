S TRONDHEIM NEED A PUBLIC LIBRARY? OPEN LETTER TO THE PARTY MEMBERS IN THETOWN COUNCIL.     THE STAFF OF TRONDHEIM PUBLIC LIBRARY, NORWAY, CONSIDER THE LATESTPOSTPONEMENT (TILL AFTER 1982) OF THE PLANNED NEW LIBRARY TOTALLYIRRESPONSIBLE. HAVING LONG TOLERATED UNSATISFACTORY CONDITIONS IN THEEXPECTATION OF IMPROVEMENT, THEY NOW DEMAND THAT THE PRESENT LIBRARY SHOULD BEBROUGHT UP TO CURRENT STANDARDS OF HEALTH AND WORK ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS,THOUGH EVEN THIS WOULD NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. MUCH OF THEBOOKSTOCK IS HOUSED ELSEWHERE FOR LACK OF SPACE, WHICH TOGETHER WITH STAFFSHORTAGES MAKES FOR UNSATISFACTORY PUBLIC SERVICE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTENDSERVICES TO THE ELDERLY, HANDICAPPED AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. ONLY ANEW LIBRARY CAN BRING TRONDHEIM INTO LINE WITH OTHER NORWEGIAN CITY LIBRARYSERVICES
