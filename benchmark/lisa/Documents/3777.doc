 OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE IN CEREALS RESEARCH.     THE USE AND EFFECT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE ON CEREALS RESEARCH INNIGERIA WAS DETERMINED BY USING A MULTI-METHOD APPROACH. ENGLISH LANGUAGE ANDINDIGENOUS AFRICAN LANGUAGE LITERATURE WAS EXCLUDED. LANGUAGES INCLUDED WEREFRENCH, GERMAN, SPANISH, RUSSIAN, JAPANESE AND CHINESE. METHODS USED IN THESURVEY WERE A TWO-YEAR ANALYSIS OF THE LOANS RECORDS OF THE NATIONAL CEREALSRESEARCH INSTITUTE LIBRARY, QUESTIONNAIRES DISTRIBUTED TO RESEARCH SCIENTISTSAND ANALYSES OF THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE REFERENCES IN RECENT PUBLICATIONS ANDTHESES OF THE SCIENTISTS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT SCIENTISTS MAKE LITTLE USE OFFOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE BECAUSE FEW OF THEM ARE ABLE TO READ THESELANGUAGES. CONSEQUENTLY SCIENTISTS ARE MISSING IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND THEREIS DUPLICATION OF RESEARCH WHICH USE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LITERATURE COULDMINIMISE. RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT FRENCH, GERMAN, CHINESE AND JAPANESE AREIMPORTANT IN CEREALS RESEARCH
