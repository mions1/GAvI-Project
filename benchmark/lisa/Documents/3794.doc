PUTER STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IN PATENTS. I.INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL STRATEGY.     THE STRATEGY OF AN APPROACH TO REPRESENTING AND SEARCHING THE GENERIC CHEMICALFORMULAS (MARKUSH FORMULAS) TYPICAL OF CHEMICAL PATENTS IS OUTLINED. THEMETHODS UNDER DEVELOPMENT INVOLVE THE FOLLOWING STAGES' (1) THE DESCRIPTION OFGENERIC CHEMICAL EXPRESSIONS BY MEANS OF A FORMAL LANGUAGE, GENSAL; ANAPPROACH TO THE GENERATION AND RECOGNITION OF SUBSTITUENTS OR RADICALS DEFINEDBY GENERIC NOMENCLATURAL EXPRESSIONS, VIA FORMAL GRAMMARS; (3) METHODS FORAUTOMATIC GENERATION OF SCREEN CHARACTERISTICS, INDIVIDUALLY AND WITHIN THERELATIONAL AND LOGICAL FRAMEWORKS DEFINED BY GENERIC FORMULAS; (4) SEARCHTECHNIQUES FOR IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC STRUCTURES AND SUBSTRUCTURES WITHINGENERIC FORMULAS BASED ON THESE METHODS
