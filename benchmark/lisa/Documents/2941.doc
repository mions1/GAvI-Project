A-TAGGING EXPERIMENT FOR ENERGY-RELATED DOCUMENTS AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTSSERVICE.     AN EXPERIMENT IS DESCRIBED THAT EVALUATED THE USEFULNESS AND ECONOMICFEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING DATA TAGS INTO SECONDARY INFORMATION FILES. TAGSARE BRIEF CODES THAT INDICATE THE PRESENCE IN A PRIMARY DOCUMENT OF SPECIFICTYPES OF NUMERICAL DATA. TAGS WERE SELECTED IN COOPERATION WITH USERS OF THEU.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S (DOE) RECON SYSTEM AND ADDED TO A SPECIAL VERSIONOF THE COMPUTER-READABLE ENERGY FILE. RECON USERS ASSISTED IN AN EVALUATION OFTHE TAGGING PROCESS. IT WAS FOUND THAT DATA TAGS DO INCREASE ACCESS TONUMERICAL DATA IN THE PRIMARY LITERATURE, BUT A FILE SPANNING SEVERAL YEARS ISNECESSARY TO PRODUCE USEFUL RESULTS. EVALUATION OF PROCESSING COSTS REVEALEDTHAT AFTER THE INITIAL TRAINING PERIOD, COSTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY GREATERFOR THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF DATA TAGS EMPLOYED IN THIS STUDY. THE FEASIBILITYOF INCLUDING DATA TAGS IN NONENERGY SECTIONS OF 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS 1WASEXAMIN ED WITH PRIMARY EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC AND EDITORIAL FACTORS. IT WASSHOWN THAT SUBJECT CONTENT GOVERNS THE SELECTION OF DATA TYPES TO BE TAGGEDFOR A SECTION OR GROUP OF RELATED SECTIONS WITH THE OVERRIDING CONSIDERATIONOF USER REQUIREMENTS
