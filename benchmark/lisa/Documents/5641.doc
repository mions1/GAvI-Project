MPUTER PROGRAMS FOR ANALYSIS OF BIBLIOMETRIC DISTRIBUTIONS.(MSC DISSERTATION-CITY UNIVERSITY, LONDON). A SUITE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS ISGIVEN FOR THE ANALYSIS OF AUTHOR AND JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY DATA. THE PROGRAMSWERE WRITTEN USING SUBPROGRAMS FROM THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIALSCIENCES, WHERE APPROPRIATE, AND USING THE FORTRAN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. THEAUTHOR PRODUCTIVITY PROGRAMS 1ST PROCESS RAW AUTHOR PRODUCTIVITY DATA(CONSISTING OF AUTHOR CODES AND ARTICLE NUMBERS). THEN THE WEIBULL, NEGATIVEBINOMIAL AND 2 FORMS OF THE LOTKA DISTRIBUTION ARE COMPARED WITH THE OBSERVEDDISTRIBUTIONS OF AUTHOR PRODUCTIVITY, USING THE CHI SQUARED ANDKOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV GOODNESS-OF-FIT TESTS. THE JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY PROGRAMSALLOW RAW JOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY DATA (CONSISTING OF JOURNAL CODES AND ARTICLENUMBERS) TO BE PROCESSED. THE PROCESSED DATA IS USED TO PLOT BRADFORD, YIELDFORMULA AND NARANAN GRAPHS BY COMPUTER. REASONS FOR CHOOSING THESE AUTHOR ANDJOURNAL PRODUCTIVITY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE G IVEN, AND APPLICATIONS OF THEPROGRAMS IN OTHER AREAS OF BIBLIOMETRICS ARE EXAMINED. FINALLY, USEFULDEVELOPMENTS TO THE SUITE OF PROGRAMS ARE CONSIDERED
