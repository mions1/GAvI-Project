RE COLLECTIONS OF JOURNALS FOR NATIONAL INTERLENDING PURPOSES.CENTRALISED NATIONAL PROVISION FOR INTERLENDING PROVIDES A BETTER SERVICE THANDECENTRALISED PROVISION BUT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT, SOPARTIAL CENTRALISATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. JOURNALS ARE SPECIALLY SUITED TOCENTRAL COLLECTIONS. CONCENTRATION OF DEMAND ON A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OFJOURNALS MEANS THAT COLLECTIONS OF 7,000-8,000 TITLES COULD SUPPLY 80% OFDEMAND AND 2,000 TITLES 50% IN MANY COUNTRIES. THERE ARE HOWEVER PROBLEMS INIDENTIFYING JOURNALS FOR CORE COLLECTIONS. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE SHOWNTO BE OF LITTLE HELP. ANALYSIS OF DEMAND AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDINGDIVISION INDICATES THAT RANK LISTS ARE NOT VERY STABLE OVER TIME; AND VARIOUSFACTORS SUCH AS LANGUAGE OR STAGE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL CAUSEVARIATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY CORE LISTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES(THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCES, ESPECIALLY IF CORE LISTSBASED ON CURRENT DEMAND COULD BE OBTAINED FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENTCOUNTRIES). ONCE A CORE COLLECTION HAD BEEN SET UP, IT WOULD HAVE TO ATTRACTSUFFICIENT REQUESTS TO MONITOR DEMAND AND ADJUST ITS CONTENTS ACCORDINGLY. IFA COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE, LIMITATION TO CERTAIN SUBJECTS HASADVANTAGES. AS COLLECTIONS GROW, ADDITIONAL JOURNALS WILL BE CHEAPER TOACQUIRE, THOUGH THE UNIT COST PER REQUEST WILL STILL BE LOWER FOR THE JOURNALSIN HEAVIEST DEMAND. CONCLUDES THAT THE CONCEPT OF CORE COLLECTIONS IS SOUND,BUT FURTHER DATA ARE NEEDED BEFORE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF SETTING UP SUCHCOLLECTIONS CAN BE PROPERLY ASSESSED
