MOTING IN-SERVICE TRAINING IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.     FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE NEDERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM(DUTCH CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) FOR A SCHEME OF IN-SERVICETRAINING FOR DUTCH LIBRARIANS THE NBLC IN 1977 CREATED A DEPARTMENT TO PROMOTETHE ACQUISITION OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE BY PRACTISING LIBRARIANS. THEDEPARTMENT OFFERS COURSES ON SUBJECTS SUCH AS THE HANDLING OF AUDIO-VISUALMATERIALS, AUTOMATION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, CHILDREN'S STORY HOURS, ANDCATALOGUING. THE COURSES ARE GIVEN BY NBLC STAFF WITH THE HELP OF PRACTISINGLIBRARIANS AND LIBRARY SCHOOL LECTURERS AND LAST FROM 5 TO 10 DAYS. IN ORDERTO RELATE THE SYLLABUS TO PRACTICAL LIBRARY SITUATIONS STUDENTS' PRACTICALEXPERIENCES ARE USED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE THEORETICAL ASPECTSOF THE COURSES. THE NBLC PLANS TO FORM A COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE THE FURTHERDEVELOPMENT OF IN-SERVICE TRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS
