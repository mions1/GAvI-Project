THE USE OF 'GROSS WEIGHT FORMULAE' OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS FOR RETRIEVAL OFINFORMATION ABOUT ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.     THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THE GROSS WEIGHT FORMULAE OF CHEMICAL COMPOUND BONDSAS FILTERS WHEN RETRIEVING INFORMATION ON INDIVIDUAL CHEMICALS AND COMPOUNDCLASSES IS CHECKED. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INDEXING AND RETRIEVING COMPOUNDSACCORDING TO GROSS WEIGHT FORMULAE AND SOME FRAGMENTAL CODES IS COMPARED. THEEASE OF AUTOMATIC CREATION OF GROSS-WEIGHT FORMULAE, THEIR GOODDIFFERENTIATING CAPABILITY, AND THEIR EXPEDIENCE WHEN RETRIEVING INFORMATIONIN LARGE FILES ARE STRESSED
