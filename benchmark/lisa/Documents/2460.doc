URE POSSIBILITIES FOR PRODUCTIVE READING.     3 SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WERE UNDERTAKEN IN AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THECONNECTION BETWEEN THE SPEED OF READING AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS READ.RESULTS SHOWED THAT SPEED AND UNDERSTANDING DO NOT CHANGE IN PARALLEL. UP TO ACRITICAL POINT THEY FOLLOW EACH OTHER; THEREAFTER FURTHER INCREASES IN SPEEDARE ACCOMPANIED BY DECREASES IN UNDERSTANDING. THIS CRITICAL POINT CAN BE USEDAS AN INDEX OF READING ABILITY FOR ANY GIVEN READER. LIBRARIES SHOULD PROMOTETHE USE OF MORE PRODUCTIVE READING TO ENCOURAGE A MORE EFFICIENT USE OF THEIRRESOURCES
