ESENT STATUS OF INORGANIC CHEMICAL NOMENCLATURE.     A SYSTEMATIC CHEMICAL NAME IS ONE WHICH PORTRAYS THE ESSENTIAL STRUCTURALFEATURES OF A CHEMICAL COMPOUND BY SOME GENERAL PATTERN. FOR MOST PURPOSES ITIS UNNECESSARY TO WRITE NOMENCLATURE RULES IN SUCH DETAIL AS TO PROVIDE ASINGLE NAME FOR EACH COMPOUND. LIKE ALL HUMAN ACTIVITIES NOMENCLATURE PATTERNSCHANGE WITH TIME. THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO MEET NEW CONDITIONS, TO SECURE GREATERGENERALITY, OR TO OBTAIN SIMPLER NAMES. WHILE NOMENCLATURE SPECIALISTS MUST BEATTUNED TO THE NEEDS OF NOMENCLATURE USERS, THEIR SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS TO BESUCCESSFUL MUST BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE USERS.
