 CURRENT STATE OF LIBRARIANSHIP TRAINING FOR ASSISTANT LIBRARIANS.IN RECENT YEARS TRAINING FOR THE HIGHER STAFF GRADES HAS UNDERGONE AFUNDAMENTAL REFORM. THE NUMBER OF LIBRARY SCHOOL GRADUATES WORKING IN ACADEMICLIBRARIES HAS NOW INCREASED. FORMERLY, ALTHOUGH ALL STAFF IN ACADEMICLIBRARIES POSSESSED UNIVERSITY DEGREES, FEW OF THEM POSSESSED QUALIFICATIONSIN LIBRARIANSHIP. IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BY CONTRAST, MOST SENIOR STAFF HAVELIBRARIANSHIP QUALIFICATIONS. THE NEW SITUATION HAS BEEN CAUSED BY LEGALCHANGES, THE FINAL RESULTS OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. ATPRESENT THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY OF COURSES AVAILABLE; THE BEST BALANCE OFTHEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL TRAINING MUST BE CHOSEN. FURTHER CONSIDERATION MUSTBE GIVEN TO THE JOINT TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS AND DOCUMENTALISTS AND TO THESALARIES OF LIBRARY SCHOOL STAFF
