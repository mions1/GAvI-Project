SEBY LIBRARY' A BIG EFFORT FOR A SMALL AUTHORITY.     NESSEBY, IN NORTHERN NORWAY, IS LARGE IN AREA (1,438 SQ.KIL.) BUT SMALL INPOPULATION (1,120 INHABITANTS). AFTER MANY YEARS OF INADEQUATE LIBRARYACCOMMODATION, A NEW COMMUNITY CENTRE INCLUDING A LIBRARY WAS OPENED IN 1980,SO WELCOME THAT THE INCREASED FINANCIAL BURDEN IS NOT RESENTED. THE LIBRARY ISIN THE BASEMENT, BUT SLOPING GROUND ALLOWS AMPLE WINDOW SPACE. FOR THE 1STTIME THERE IS A LOAN COUNTER, A LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE, AND ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THE4,500 BOOKS. THE ADDITION OF A PROPOSED MOBILE LIBRARY WOULD ENSURE A GOODLIBRARY SERVICE TO THE AREA, THOUGH EXPANSION WILL BE NECESSARY IN TIME
