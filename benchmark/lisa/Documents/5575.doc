ILDREN, LIBRARIES AND COMICS IN MEXICO.DESCRIBES A VISIT TO MEXICO AND THE US FINANCED BENJAMIN FRANKLIN LIBRARY INGUADELAJARA BRIEFLY. THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY ATTACHED TO THE 'CENTRO SOCIALMORELOS' IN AGUASCALIENTES SUFFERS FROM LACK OF SPACE AND MATERIAL, AND THEUNQUALIFIED LIBRARIAN'S MAIN DUTY IS TO KEEP ORDER. FEW PUBLIC LIBRARIES LENDBOOKS. THE STREAM OF PULP MAGAZINES AND COMICS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN IS NOWBEING COUNTERED BY THE STATE, WHO PUBLISHES MATERIAL IN SIMILAR STYLE, BUTBETTER CONTENT. THE LIBRARY IN SAN CRISTOBAL RECEIVES MONEY FOR STAFF SALARIESBUT NONE FOR BOOKS. LIKE OTHER LIBRARIES, BIBLIOTECA DE MEXICO IS USED MAINLYBY STUDENTS. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE CAME ON A MORE ORGANISED FOOTING IN1978, AND AS NO SCHOOL LIBRARIES EXIST, CREATION OF CHILDREN'S SECTIONS ISRECEIVING PRIORITY. THERE IS GREAT DEMAND FOR THE LIBRARIANS TRAINED AT THE 6UNIVERSITIES BUT MANY ARE ATTRACTED INTO PRIVATE FIRMS. CONTINUITY OF LIBRARYPLANNING IS HAMPERED BY THE CHANGES OF  CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION EVERY 6 YEARS
