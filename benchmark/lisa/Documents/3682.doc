DISCUSSES THE LIBRARY BILL PROPOSED BY THE DANISH CHRISTIAN PEOPLES' PARTY, AMINORITY PARTY WHOSE PROPOSAL HAS NO CHANCE OF BECOMING LAW, BUT MIGHT YETINFLUENCE THE RULING SOCIAL DEMOCRATS' PROPOSAL. THE C.P.P. SUPPORTS THELIBRARY COMMISSION'S MINORITY REPORT AND PREFERS THAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES AREADMINISTERED BY THE MINISTRY OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS, WHILE RESEARCH, EDUCATIONALAND SCHOOL LIBRARIES COME UNDER THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION. BUT UNLIKE THEMINORITY REPORT, IT SUGGESTS THAT NO NON-BOOK MATERIALS AND CULTURALACTIVITIES SHOULD RECEIVE STATE SUPPORT, AND THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO THEINDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY WHETHER TO CHARGE FOR THESE OR FINANCE THEM OUT OF THELOCAL RATES. EXEMPTED FROM THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE LENDING OF AUDIO-VISUALMATERIALS TO THE DISABLED. IT SUPPORTS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITYAND ITS DECISIVE INFLUENCE ON BOOK SELECTION. A BLOCK GRANT SYSTEM OFFINANCING WOULD ALSO AID LOCAL INDEPENDENCE
