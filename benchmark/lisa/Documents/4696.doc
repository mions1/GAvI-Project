 CULTURAL POLICY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.     THE TEXT OF A TALK GIVEN TO A CONFERENCE ON LIBRARIES IN THE ICY WIND OFCULTURAL POLICY, HELD IN JARFALLA, MAY 81. IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE CULTURALPOLICY THE CULTURAL PRODUCERS MUST INFORM THEMSELVES OF THE WHOLE SPHERE OFLOCAL POLITICS. LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE NO LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE CULTURALACTIVITIES AND LEGISLATION LAYING DOWN MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES,AS IN FINLAND, SHOULD BE ENACTED. AFTER THE BOOM IN THE 60S AND 70S, THE LOCALAUTHORITIES HAVE TO MAKE CUTS; AS THEY CANNOT REDUCE PREVIOUS CAPITALINVESTMENT THEY CUT CURRENT EXPENDITURE ON CULTURAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SCHOOLSAND LIBRARIES, ALTHOUGH MONEY SEEMS ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR SPORT, BUREAUCRACYAND DATA TECHNOLOGY. THE REAL POWER OF DECISION-MAKING LIES NOT WITH THECULTURAL, BUT WITH THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUDGETING.CULTURAL CONSUMERS SHOULD BE AS POLITICALLY ACTIVE AS THE PRESSURE GROUPS FORSPORT AND TRY TO INFLUENCE LOCAL POLITICIANS,  IF A CATASTROPHE FOR CULTURE ISTO BE AVERTED
