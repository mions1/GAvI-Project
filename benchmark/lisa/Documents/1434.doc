T PASSAGE RETRIEVAL BASED ON COLON CLASSIFICATION' RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE.A SET OF EXPERIMENTS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY OF THE COLONCLASSIFICATION AS A FOUNDATION FOR THE AUTOMATED ANALYSIS, REPRESENTATION ANDRETRIEVAL OF PRIMARY INFORMATION FROM THE FULL TEXT OF DOCUMENTS. FULL TEXTDATA BASES WERE CREATED IN 2 SUBJECT AREAS AND QUERIES SOLICITED FROMSPECIALISTS IN EACH AREA. AN AUTOMATED FULL TEXT INDEXING SYSTEM, ALONG WITH 4AUTOMATED PASSAGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, WAS CREATED TO TEST THE VARIOUS FEATURESOF THE COLON CLASSIFICATION. 2 BOOLEAN-BASED SYSTEMS AND 1 SIMPLE WORDOCCURRENCE SYSTEM WERE CREATED IN ORDER TO COMPARE THE RETRIEVAL RESULTSAGAINST TYPES OF SYSTEMS WHICH ARE IN MORE COMMON USE. THE SYSTEMS' RETRIEVALPERFORMANCES WERE MEASURED USING RECALL AND PRECISION AND THE MEAN EXPECTEDSEARCH LENGTH REDUCTION FACTORS. OVERALL, COLON-BASED SYSTEMS DID NOT PERFORMSIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE OTHER SYSTEMS
