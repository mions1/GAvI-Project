ONG FAREWELL TO 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS.THE USE OF 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS AS A PRINCIPLE ELEMENT IN CATCHWORD CATALOGUESIS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE. THE TERM 'NARROW' IS TOO VAGUE AND DOES NOT CONVEYTHE CONTENT AND MEANING WHICH IT SHOULD. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'CATCHWORD HAS ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS DEFINING A CLASSIFICATION METHOD; THISIS HOWEVER, NOT THE CASE. LIBRARIES WOULD BE ADVISED TO CONFORM WITH STANDARDTERMINOLOGY USED IN DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TO AVOID FURTHERUSE OF THE 'NARROW' CATCHWORD OR 'NARROW' TERM. THE CONTROL OF CLASSIFICATIONTERMINOLOGY IS A VERY IMPORTANT AREA OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WHICH SHOULD BE MORECLEARLY DEFINED. EXAMINING SUCH TERMS AS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'CATCHWORD IS, THEREFORE, 1 STEP TOWARDS ELIMINATING TERMINOLOGY WHICH HAS NOREAL MEANING OR USE
