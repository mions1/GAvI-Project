IGNING OPTICAL MARK FORMS FOR REFERENCE STATISTICS.DATA ARE RECORDED ON OPTICAL MARK FORMS USING A SOFT PENCIL TO PLACE A SERIESOF MARKS IN SPECIFIED AREAS, A TECHNIQUE THAT IS COMMONLY USED ON EXAMINATIONANSWER SHEETS. THE DATA ARE THEN AVAILABLE FOR COMPUTER TABULATION ANDANALYSIS. REFERENCE-DESK STATISTICS CAN EFFICIENTLY BE COLLECTED INMACHINE-READABLE FORM BY USING SUCH A TECHNIQUE. INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THEDESIGN OF AN OPTICAL MARK FORM IS PRESENTED ALONG WITH IMPORTANT SOFTWARECONSIDERATIONS. THE OVERRIDING CONCERN WHEN DESIGNING AN OPTICAL MARK FORM TOBE USED AT THE REFERENCE DESK IS TO PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO RECORD ALLNECESSARY INFORMATION WHILE REQUIRING AS FEW MARKS AS POSSIBLE. USEFUL DATACATEGORIES ARE IDENTIFIED, AND FIGURES ILLUSTRATE HOW DATA CAN BE RECORDED FOREACH CATEGORY.
