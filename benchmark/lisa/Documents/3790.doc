HNOLOGY AND THE INFORMATION PROFESSIONAL: WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?.     EXAMINES THE LIKELY IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY ON LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATIONSCIENTISTS, AND ON DATA BASE PRODUCERS, OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. DATA BASEPRODUCERS WILL INCREASINGLY RELY ON HOME-BASED ABSTRACTORS WHO RECEIVE, CREATEAND SEND ALL THEIR MATERIAL BY ELECTRONIC MEANS. THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCHPROCEDURES FOR THE DATA BASE PRODUCERS ARE OUTLINED. INCREASING USE OFVIDEODISCS FOR INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL IS ENVISAGED. THE IMPACT OFNEW TECHNOLOGY ON LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION SCIENTISTS IS THEN EXAMINED. USEOF VIDEODISCS WILL MEAN A DECLINE IN THE USE OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.USE OF INTELLIGENT TERMINALS WILL LEAD TO GREATER USE OF THESE SYSTEMS BYEND-USERS. THE INTELLIGENT TERMINALS COULD BE USED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARELANGUAGES, TO REFINE SEARCH STRATEGIES, TO STORE AND EDIT OUTPUT FROM SEARCHESAND TO ADVISE USERS ON THE BEST DATA BASES AND BEST SEARCH STRATEGY TO USE.ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THOSE LEADING TO THE 'OFFICE OFTHE FUTURE'. CONCLUDES THAT THERE WILL BE A DRAMATIC SHAKEOUT INLIBRARIANSHIP, BUT THAT INFORMATION SCIENTISTS FACE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TODEVELOP THEIR SKILLS BY THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. ITIS RECOMMENDED THAT SCHOOLS OF INFORMATION SCIENCE TEACH THEIR STUDENTS TYPINGSKILLS. FINALLY, SOME REMARKS ABOUT THE ADVISABILITY OF OFFERING SOPHISTICATEDINFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS TO LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ARE MADE
