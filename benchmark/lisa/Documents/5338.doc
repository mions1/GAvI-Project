EADER'S VIEW OF EAST ASIAN CATALOGUE AUTOMATION.DISCUSSES WHETHER AUTOMATION IS PREFERABLE FOR CATALOGUES OF CHINESE LANGUAGEMATERIALS IN AUSTRALIA. PRESENTS A BRIEF HISTORY OF CATALOGUING ANDCLASSIFICATION IN CHINA. THE ROMANISED CATALOGUE IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER IS MOSTSUITED TO AUTOMATION BUT A SUPPLEMENTARY CHARACTER-BASED CATALOGUE FOR LARGEEAST ASIAN HOLDINGS WOULD HELP USERS MORE FAMILIAR WITH CHARACTERS AND WITHDIFFERENT PRONUNCIATIONS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS. SUGGESTS THATLIBRARIANS SHOULD HOLD BACK AUTOMATION UNTIL AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM WHICH CANCOPE WITH BOTH ROMANISED AND CHARACTER DATA AT A REASONABLE COST IS DEVELOPEDAND THEN AIM FOR A CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SYSTEM FOR ALL EAST ASIAN MATERIALSTHROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, POSSIBLY BASED ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA BUTWITH INPUT FROM ALL LIBRARIES WITH EAST ASIAN MATERIALS
