ORY OF CORRELATION TABLES. 1.A POSSIBLE MATHEMATICAL MODEL IS PRESENTED FOR CORRELATION TABLES USED INSPECTROSCOPY. A PROCESS BASED ON INFORMATION THEORY IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH ANEXAMPLE FOR THE OPTIMUM CONSTRUCTION OF CORRELATION TABLES. IN THIS EXAMPLETHE CONSTRUCTION OF AN NMR CORRELATION TABLE IS INVESTIGATED; THE METHOD ISGENERAL AND IS SUITABLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CORRELATION TABLES USED INCOMPUTERISED EVALUATION OF SPECTRA
