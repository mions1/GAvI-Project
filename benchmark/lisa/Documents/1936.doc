DLOCK AVOIDANCE IN STORE-AND-FORWARD NETWORKS.     STORE-AND-FORWARD NETWORK DEADLOCKS MAY BE AVOIDED BY FORWARDING MESSAGES FROMBUFFER TO BUFFER IN ACCORDANCE WITH A LOOP-FREE DIRECTED BUFFER GRAPH WHICHACCOMMODATES ALL THE DESIRED MESSAGE ROUTES. USE OF GUARANTEED PATHS IN THEBUFFER GRAPH AND OPTIONAL PATH SWITCHING ARE DESCRIBED, ALONG WITH MESSAGERECLASSIFICATION TO FREE MEMBERS OF THE COMMON BUFFER POOL. AN EFFICIENTBUFFER-COUNTING PROCEDURE IN EACH NODE HANDLES MESSAGES REQUIRING SEVERALBUFFERS, INCREASES FLEXIBILITY OF BUFFER USAGE, MINIMISES OVERHEADS DURINGMESSAGE RECLASSIFICATION OR PATH SWITCHING, AND SIMPLIFIES JUMPING BETWEENNORMAL LOW-OVERHEAD OPERATION WHEN DEADLOCK IS FAR AND MORE CAREFUL OPERATIONWHEN DEADLOCK IS NEAR
