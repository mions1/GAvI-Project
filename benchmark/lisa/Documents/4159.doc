WHEREAS BEFORE THEWAR MOST PEOPLE VISITED THE CINEMA OR THEATRE FOR ENTERTAINMENT, AND TRAVELLEDBY BUS OR TRAIN, NOWADAYS THEY WATCH TELEVISION AT HOME AND TRAVEL BY PRIVATECAR. SIMILARLY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN USES THE LIBRARY NOT ASA SUBSTITUTE FOR A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF BOOKS BUT TO SUPPLEMENT HIS OWNCOLLECTION.
