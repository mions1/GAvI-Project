GROW OR NOT TO GROW?.     ENUMERATES AND COMMENTS ON THE MANY FACTORS THAT CAUSE INCREASED NEED FORACADEMIC LIBRARY SPACE. SINCE THE COLLECTION OCCUPIES ONLY FROM 25-45% OF THEFLOORSPACE IN LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, THESE OTHER FACTORS MUST ALSO BESTUDIED AND REMEDIED IN ORDER TO LIMIT BUILDING GROWTH. THE FOLLOWING MEASURESTO SLOW THE INCREASE IN STORAGE SPACE ARE REVIEWED IN DETAIL' WEEDING;ZERO-GROWTH; COMPACT STORAGE; COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS; MINIATURISATION. INCONNECTION WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF STORED MATERIALS, DETAILED ARGUMENTS ARECITED WHY BROWSING IS AN INSUFFICIENT RETRIEVAL DEVICE FOR SERIOUS RESEARCH.THE POINT IS MADE THAT A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE MEASURES IS NEEDED TO REDUCESPACE PRESSURES INHERITED FROM THE PAST. FURTHERMORE, IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OFTHE STUDIES SHOWING THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF ACQUIRED WORKS IS RARELY IF EVERUSED, A MORE LIMITED AND REGIONALLY COORDINATED SELECTION POLICY IS NEEDED TOREDUCE FUTURE SPACE PRESSURES
