PITAL LIBRARY RESOURCES IN MASSACHUSETTS' DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS.     MASSACHUSETTS HOSPITALS WERE SURVEYED TO ESTABLISH SOME RANGES AND BASE LINESTATISTICS FOR HOSPITAL MEDICAL INFORMATION RESOURCES. DATA WERE EVALUATED INTERMS OF THEORETICAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATION OFHOSPITALS STANDARDS AS WELL AS THE MORE SPECIFIC PROPOSED APPENDICES TO THECANADIAN STANDARDS FOR HOSPITAL LIBRARIES. THE STUDY QUANTIFIES HOSPITALLIBRARY RESOURCES AND SERVICES IN A STATE WITH A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ACUTECARE FACILITIES. 67.6% OF THOSE STUDIES WERE JUDGED AS MEETING EITHER THEREVISED JCAH OR THE CANADIAN CRITERIA. THE CENTRAL FINDING IS THAT THE 100- TO299-BED HOSPITALS REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES WHEN EVALUATEDAGAINST EITHER QUANTITATIVE OR NONQUANTITATIVE STANDARDS.
