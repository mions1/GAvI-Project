PUTER STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IN PATENTS. 2.GENSAL, A FORMAL LANGUAGE FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.     A FORMAL LANGUAGE, GENSAL, IS DESCRIBED WHICH IS DESIGNED FOR THE CONCISE ANDUNAMBIGUOUS REPRESENTATION OF GENERIC STRUCTURES FROM CHEMICAL PATENTS('MARKUSH FORMULAS') IN A MANNER WHICH IS INTELLIGIBLE TO A CHEMIST, YETSUFFICIENTLY FORMALISED FOR AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS BY A COMPUTER. GENSAL CONTAINSA NUMBER OF FACILITIES FOR SHOWING THE ALTERNATIVES POSSIBLE IN A GENERICSTRUCTURE AND ANY SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THEIR VARIETY. EXPERIENCE TODATE SUGGESTS THAT GENSAL IS CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH MOST OF THE TYPES OFGENERIC STATEMENT ENCOUNTERED IN PATENTS
