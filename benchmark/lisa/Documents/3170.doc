HODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE TO LIBRARIES.     THE AIM OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF BULGARIA IS TO TRANSFORM ALL BULGARIANCITIZENS INTO HARMONIOUS PERSONALITIES. THIS EFFORT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIALPARTICIPATION BY LIBRARIES, BOTH PUBLIC AND SPECIAL. THE NUMBER OF READERS ANDFREQUENCY OF LOANS MUST BE MONITORED. THUS LIBRARIANS MUST BECOME FAMILIAR NOTONLY WITH THEIR READERS' INTERESTS BUT ALSO WITH THE DETAILS OF THE LITERATUREPRESENTED TO THEM. LIBRARIANS MUST NOT BE LEFT ALONE BUT ASSISTED AND GUIDEDEVEN MORE THAN BEFORE BY EXPERT ADVISERS, WORKING IN PARTICULAR AT THEMETHODOLOGICAL CENTRES OF REGIONAL CENTRAL LIBRARIES. THEIR WORK MUST BEADAPTED TO THE NEW, MUCH MORE COMPLICATED REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1980S AND BEMORE EFFICIENT, TOO. BUREAUCRACY AND FORMALISM HAVE TO BE ELIMINATED,ACTIVITIES MUCH BETTER COORDINATED. THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARYIN SOFIA MUST RETAIN LEADERSHIP IN THIS FIELD
