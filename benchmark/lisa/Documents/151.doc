DEMANDS TO REMODEL LIBRARY CONDITIONS AT THE 5 'OLD' UNIVERSITIES(TECHNICAL COLLEGES) IN THE STATE OF NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA.THE 1979/80 LIBRARY GUIDE TO THE AACHEN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FUNCTIONSSIMULTANEOUSLY AS A CRITIQUE OF CONDITIONS AT THE LIBRARY. AACHEN IS NOW AUNIVERSITY WITH ALMOST 30,000 STUDENTS BUT THE LIBRARY SYSTEM IS LARGELYDECENTRALISED WITH MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES. SOME OF THESE HAVE BEENREORGANISED AND REHOUSED, BUT MANY STILL NEED TO BE RESTRUCTURED. THERE IS ALACK OF CENTRALISATION AND COORDINATION WHICH CAN BE FOUND OUT MOST OF THE'OLD' NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE NOT PLANNED, CAMPUSUNIVERSITIES. THERE IS A NEED FOR A COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF LIBRARY STOCK.LIBRARY GUIDES SUCH AS THE AACHEN EXAMPLE ARE OF GREAT VALUEAND SHOULD BEPUBLISHED AT ALL THE LIBRARIES. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO INTEGRATE SMALLINSTITUTE LIBRARIES TO IMPROVE COORDINATION WORK. LIBRARIANS ARE OF THEOPINION THAT LIBRARIES SHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUAL CASES AND THAT PLANSAND LAWS FOR REMODELLING LIBRARY CONDITIONS SHOULD BEWARE OF GENERALISATION
