HABETIZATION IN INDEXES: EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES.     DISCUSSES THE RESPECTIVE ADVANTAGES OF THE 'LETTER BY LETTER' AND 'WORD BYWORD' SYSTEM OF ALPHABETISATION, AND PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL STUDIESOF HOW STUDENTS AND CHILDREN SEQUENCE WORDS AND RETRIEVE ITEMS FROM INDEXESWITH DIFFERENT SEQUENCES. CONCLUDES THAT STUDENTS USE A VARIETY OF METHODSWHEN ASKED TO PUT WORDS IN ORDER FOR AN INDEX, WITH SENSE AND MEANING BEING APRIME CONSIDERATION. SCHOOLCHILDREN, HOWEVER, WERE FOUND TO BE LESS AMBITIOUSIN THIS RESPECT, AND TO ORDER WORDS ALPHABETICALLY USING THE LETTER BY LETTERMETHOD. NO 1 METHOD OF SEQUENCING INDEXES WAS FOUND TO LEAD TO BETTERRETRIEVAL THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS USED, AND IT APPEARS THAT EITHER OF THE 2METHODS CURRENTLY USED BY INDEXERS CAN BE EMPLOYED WITHOUT CAUSING UNDUEDIFFICULTY FOR YOUNG READERS
