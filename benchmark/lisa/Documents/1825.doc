AL SYSTEMS' DESIGN AND COSTS.     CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY ANDINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. A LOCAL APPROACH TO THEAUTOMATION OF ACQUISITIONS PROCESSES WAS, UNTIL COMPARATIVELY RECENTLY, THEONLY ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE. GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN PROCESS ARE WELLDOCUMENTED; COSTS ARE NOT. INVESTIGATES PITFALLS TO A LOCAL APPROACH AND LISTSALTERNATIVES. EXPLORES TRENDS SUCH AS THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF INTERFACEWITH NATIONAL OR OTHER LOCAL SYSTEMS, AND THE GREATER DEMANDS FOR MANAGERIALDATA. SUGGESTS THAT A LESS RIGID, TRADITIONAL APPROACH TOWARDS AUTOMATINGACQUISITIONS FUNCTIONS MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE, AND THAT A THOROUGHINVESTIGATION OF AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES SHOULD PRECEDE A DECISION TO ADOPT ORMAINTAIN A TOTALLY LOCAL APPROACH
