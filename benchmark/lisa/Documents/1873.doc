 DUALITY OF CLASSIFICATION' TAXONOMY AND MERONOMY.     CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON CURRENT TRENDS IN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH. IN THECONTEXT OF NATURAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT, CLASSIFICATION ISVIEWED AS THE GROUPING OF OBJECTS IN CLASSES (TAXONS) AND AS THE FINDING OFCOMMON STRUCTURES (ARCHETYPES) WITHIN THE OBJECTS. AN ARCHETYPE IS A STRUCTUREOF PARTS (MERONS). THE CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURE CAN BE REPRESENTED AS ANINTERACTIVE PROCESS WHEREBY THE GROUPING BY TAXONS ALTERNATES WITH THEIDENTIFICATION OF TAXON ARCHETYPES, WHICH ARE USED AGAIN TO UPDATE THE TAXONCOMPOSITION. PRESENTS A MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEENTHE TAXONOMIC GROUPING OF OBJECTS AND THEIR PARTITIONING INTO MERONS, WITHSPECIAL MENTION OF THE METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF CLASSIFICATION
