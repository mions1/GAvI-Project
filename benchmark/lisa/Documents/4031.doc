WITH GROWTH COMES COMPLEXITY; AND LIBRARIANSHIP BECOMESINCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS IT GROWS. A 2-FOLD APPROACH TO THE UNDERSTANDING OFLIBRARIANSHIP IS SUGGESTED.

PROPOSES AMODEL OF 'METALIBRARIANSHIP' BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS, AND INVOLVING ASSUMPTIONSABOUT ITS NATURE IN TERMS OF THE MECHANISM, EXPANDED CONTEXTUALISM ANDFORMISM, AND SUGGESTING THAT THE PRIMARY ROOT METAPHOR OF METALIBRARIANSHIP ISTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GENERIC BOOK, ITS SUBJECT MATTER, AND ITS READER
