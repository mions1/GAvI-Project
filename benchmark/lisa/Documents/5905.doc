DOLPH FOCKE AND THE THEORY OF THE CLASSIFIED CATALOG.BETWEEN 1900 AND 1905, RUDOLPH FOCKE PUBLISHED A SERIES OF PAPERS ONCLASSIFICATION THEORY AND A DRAFT OF CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CLASSIFIEDCATALOGUES. HIS WORK WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE REFORM OF LIBRARIANSHIPDURING THE LAST DECADES OF THE 19TH CENTURY. THE LARGE NUMBER OFCLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS USED BY GERMAN UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES WASSEEN AS AN OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICCONTROL AND ACCESS. THE HOPE OF STANDARDISATION CAME TO NOTHING; FOCKE'S CODEMAY EVEN HAVE HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF PERPETUATING LOCAL SYSTEMS WELL INTOTHE 20TH CENTURY. HIS WORK WAS INTRODUCED TO LIBRARIANS IN THE USA AT A TIMEWHEN SUBJECT CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION WERE IN TRANSITION. HIS CODE ISCONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESSCLASSIFICATION, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INFLUENCED BY 19TH CENTURY GERMANCLASSIFICATION THAN HAS HERTOFORE BEEN RECOGNISED.
