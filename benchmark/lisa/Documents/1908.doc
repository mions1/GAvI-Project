WERING THE CHALLENGE OF TELETEXT, VIEWDATA SYSTEMS AND OTHER FAST GROWINGCOMMUNICATIONS, SUCH AS HOME COMPUTERS.     NEWSPAPERS ARE FACING CHALLENGES FROM THE NEW MEDIA OF TELETEXT, VIEWDATASYSTEMS, AND HOME COMPUTERS. TELETEXT PROVIDES NEWS IMMEDIATELY, SIMPLY,CONVENIENTLY, AND INEXPENSIVELY. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE BROWSE ANDSCAN OPTIONS OF NEWSPAPERS.
