AGNATION IN THE KIBBUTZ LIBRARY.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIES ARE GIVING CAUSE FOR CONCERN;DECENTRALISATION; AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIANS. DECENTRALISATIONHAS HISTORIC AND SOCIAL CAUSES. FORMERLY, MOST LIBRARIANS WERE VOLUNTEERS ANDVARIOUS GROUPS IN THE KIBBUTZ POPULATION HAD SEPARATE AREAS OF RESIDENCE ANDACTIVITY. MODERN KIBBUTZ SOCIETY AND ORGANISATION HAVE CHANGED, BUT MANY SMALLLIBRARIES HAVE REMAINED IN EXISTENCE. DECENTRALISATION HAS MANY DRAWBACKS'INEFFICIENCY, AREAS OF INTEREST NOT COVERED BY ANY LIBRARY, INCONVENIENCE OFMANY READERS AND LACK OF A STRONG LIBRARY THAT COULD BECOME A FOCAL POINT INTHE CULTURAL LIFE OF THE KIBBUTZ. THE 24 LIBRARIANS SERVING IN THE KIBBUTZIMSURVEYED AVERAGED 53.3 YEARS, ONLY 5 OF THEM BEING YOUNGER THAN 50. THISSITUATION RULES OUT MUCH IN THE WAY OF DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION.
