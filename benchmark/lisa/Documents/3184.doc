ISPENSIBLE CONSIDERATIONS IN AUTOMATING LIBRARY TECHNIQUES.     LIBRARIES, DESPITE THEIR TRADITION-MINDED REPUTATION, ALWAYS WERE SENSIBLEABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THEIR DUTIES AND OPEN TO INNOVATIONS.CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTER TECHNIQUES HERE IS DISCUSSED. THESESYSTEMS USUALLY ARE NOT DEVELOPED ON UNIQUE PRINCIPLES FOR LIBRARY PURPOSES,BUT HAVE BEEN ADAPTED FROM PRINCIPLES ALREADY EXISTING IN OTHER APPLICATIONS.SOME OF THESE PRINCIPLES ARE MORE APT FOR APPLICATION IN LIBRARIES THAN OTHERSREGARDING THE SPECIAL DUTIES OF LIBRARIES TOWARDS THEIR USERS.
