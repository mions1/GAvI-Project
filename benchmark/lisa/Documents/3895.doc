CIFICATION AND UNCONSTRAINED ENUMERATION OF CONFORMATIONS OF CHEMICALSTRUCTURES FOR COMPUTER-ASSISTED STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION.     A SYMMETRY GROUP CALLED THE CONFORMATION SYMMETRY GROUP (CFSG) WHICH PROVIDESA METHOD OF UNIQUELY SPECIFYING MOLECULAR CONFORMATION BASED ON AN APPROPRIATEDISCRETE BOND PROPERTY (SUCH AS ROTAMERIC STATE) IS FORMULATED. THE METHOD ISAPPLICABLE TO ENTIRE CHEMICAL STRUCTURES AS WELL AS SUBSTRUCTURES. THE CFSGCAN BE USED TO BUILD A SIMPLE 'ACYCLIC' CONFORMATION GENERATOR AND LEADS TO ASOLUTION FOR A HERETOFORE UNSOLVED PROBLEM IN CONFORMATION ENUMERATION
