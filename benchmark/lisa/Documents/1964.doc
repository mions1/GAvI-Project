UAL COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY' PRIORITIES FOR THE 1980S.     SINCE THE LATE 1970S, THE JAPANESE NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE PUBLICCORPORATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTING RESEARCH TO DETERMINE WHICH VISUALCOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND STUDY PROGRAMMES WILL BE REQUIRED IN THE 1980S.MARKET RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT TO ASCERTAIN THE MAJOR VISUAL COMMUNICATIONSREQUIREMENTS IN LEADING BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS. THE SYSTEMS FOUND TO HAVE THEGREATEST POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT WERE VIDEOCONFERENCING, INTERACTIVEINFORMATION RETRIEVAL, FACSIMILE, DOCUMENT PROCESSING, AND OFFICE AUTOMATION(THE LATTER INTEGRATING ALL 4 SYSTEMS). IN THE LIGHT OF THESE RESULTS,SUGGESTS A STUDY PROGRAMME FOR THE 80S AND INDICATES WHICH TECHNOLOGIES SHOULDBE DEVELOPED
