UCTURE GENERATION ON THE BASIS OF BCT REPRESENTATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.     A METHOD OF STRUCTURE GENERATION BASED ON BCT (BLOCK-CUTPOINT TREE)REPRESENTATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THE GENERATIONPROGRAM IS A PART OF THE AUTOMATIC STRUCTURE ANALYSIS SYSTEM OF MASS SPECTRA(ASASMAS) AND IS USED WHEN A SET OF THE INFERRED SUBSTRUCTURES ARE GIVEN ASINPUT DATA. THE INPUT SUBSTRUCTURES ARE REPRESENTED BY MEANS OF BCT
