 MEASUREMENT OF TERM IMPORTANCE IN AUTOMATIC INDEXING.THE FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF TERMS IN THE DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION HAVEBEEN USED AS INDICATORS OF TERM IMPORTANCE FOR CONTENT ANALYSIS AND INDEXINGPURPOSES. IN PARTICULAR, VERY RARE OR VERY FREQUENT TERMS ARE NORMALLYBELIEVED TO BE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN MEDIUM-FREQUENCY TERMS. RECENTLY AUTOMATICINDEXING THEORIES HAVE BEEN DEVISED THAT USE NOT ONLY THE TERM FREQUENCYCHARACTERISTICS BUT ALSO THE RELEVANCE PROPERTIES OF THE TERMS. THE MAJORTERM-WEIGHTING THEORIES ARE 1ST BRIEFLY REVIEWED. THE TERM PRECISION AND TERMUTILITY WEIGHTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TERMSIN THE RELEVANT, AS OPPOSED TO THE NONRELEVANT, DOCUMENTS OF A COLLECTION ARETHEN INTRODUCED. METHODS ARE SUGGESTED FOR ESTIMATING THE RELEVANCE PROPERTIESOF THE TERMS BASED ON THEIR OVERALL OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS IN THECOLLECTION. FINALLY, EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION RESULTS ARE SHOWN COMPARING THEWEIGHTING SYSTEMS USING THE TERM RELEVANCE PROPERTIES WITH THE MORECONVENTIONAL FREQUENCY-BASED METHODOLOGIES
