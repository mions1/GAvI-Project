RANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR END-USER OPERATION OF HETEROGENEOUSRETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. 2. EVALUATIONS.THE EVALUATION OF THE CONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FORSIMPLIFYING OPERATION OF MULTIPLE, HETEROGENEOUS ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHICRETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN. AN EXPERIMENTAL RETRIEVAL SYSTEM, NAMEDCONIT, WAS BUILT AND TESTED UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS WITH INEXPERIENCED ENDUSERS. A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL USAGES SHOWED THAT USERS WEREABLE TO MASTER INTERFACE OPERATION SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO FIND RELEVANT DOCUMENTREFERENCES. SUCCESS WAS ATTRIBUTED, IN PART, TO A SIMPLE COMMAND LANGUAGE,ADEQUATE ON-LINE INSTRUCTION, AND A SIMPLIFIED NATURAL LANGUAGE, KEYWORD/STEMAPPROACH TO SEARCHING. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT OPERATIONAL INTERFACES OF THE TYPESTUDIED CAN PROVIDE FOR INCREASED USABILITY OF EXISTING SYSTEMS IN A COSTEFFECTIVE MANNER, ESPECIALLY FOR INEXPERIENCED END USERS WHO CANNOT EASILYAVAIL THEMSELVES OF EXPERT INTERMEDIARY SEARCHERS. FURTHERMO RE, MORE ADVANCEDINTERFACES BASED ON IMPROVED INSTRUCTION AND AUTOMATED SEARCH STRATEGYTECHNIQUES COULD FURTHER ENHANCE RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS FOR A WIDE CLASS OFUSERS.
