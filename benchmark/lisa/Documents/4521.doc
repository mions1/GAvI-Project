IENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS IN BULGARIAN LIBRARIES.     AFTER THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTION IN BULGARIA IN 1944, ALMOST 62% OF PUBLICLIBRARIES WERE ALLOCATED LARGER PREMISES. 5 OF THE CENTRAL REGIONAL LIBRARIES,ESTABLISHED AS SUCH IN 1953, MOVED INTO NEW BUILDINGS, WHILE 2 OTHER BUILDINGSWERE ERECTED FOR LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. IN SPITE OF THESEIMPROVEMENTS, THERE IS STILL A CONSIDERABLE SHORTAGE OF SPACE IN LIBRARIES,WHICH, IN GENERAL, ARE ALSO IN NEED OF MODERNISATION. REPROGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT,COMPUTER APPLICATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY MUST NOT ONLY ENSURE BETTERLENDING SERVICES, INCLUDING INTERLENDING, BUT ALSO COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATIONRESOURCES AS WELL AS A WIDER DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. LIKE OTHERCOUNTRIES, MOBILE LIBRARIES SHOULD CATER FOR HAMLETS AND SMALL COMMUNITIES OFSOME 1,000 INHABITANTS, AND ALSO FOR URBAN POPULATIONS LIVING ON NEW HOUSINGESTATES AND/OR IN OTHER AREAS TEMPORARILY WITHOUT LIBRARIES. PURPOSE-BUILTBUILDINGS SHOULD BE ENVISAGED FOR E VERY LIBRARY WITH 70,000 AND MORE VOLUMES.DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES, BOTH ON A NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL, SHOULD ALSO BEPLANNED TO STORE VALUABLE BOOKS AND RARELY REQUESTED BOOKS
