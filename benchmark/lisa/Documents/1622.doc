EST OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE LITERATURE HISTORY OF FOUR HISTORICALACCOUNTS OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICS PROBLEM.     EXAMINES 4 HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICS PROBLEM IN PHYSICS.THE PURPOSE IS TO DESCRIBE THE LITERATURE USED BY THE HISTORIES QUANTITATIVELYUSING FREQUENCY OF DATA OF PUBLICATION. ADDITIONALLY, 1 OF THE HISTORIES WASTESTED AGAINST THE OTHER 3 TO DETERMINE DIFFERENCES. A MOMENTS TEST AND A TTEST WERE EMPLOYED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THE LITERATURE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS,WHEN PLOTTED AS A FUNCTION OF FREQUENCY OF PUBLICATION DATE IS NON-NORMAL,NEGATIVELY SKEWED, AND IS PLATYKURTIC. THE TEST FOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ONEHISTORY AND THE CUMULATIVE HISTORIES WAS NON-SIGNIFICANT. INTERPRETATIONS OFTHE RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED
