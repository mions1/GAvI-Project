E UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION.     THE BRADFORD DISTRIBUTION DIFFERS FROM MOST PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS IN THATIT IS CONCERNED WITH THE RANK-ORDER S OF THE ELEMENTS IN TERMS OF THEIRPRODUCTIVITY (FROM HIGHEST DOWN TO LOWEST) RATHER THAN WITH THE NUMERICALVALUES N OF THE ELEMENT'S PRODUCTIVITY. THE DEFINING RELATIONSHIP IS THAT S ISEXPONENTIALLY RELATED TO G, THE CUMULATIVE PRODUCTION OF THE ELEMENTS OFRANK-ORDER S OR LESS. THIS IMPLIES A ZIPF-LIKE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEANPRODUCTIVITY AND RANK-ORDER, WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO THE WEBER-FECHNER LAW OFPSYCHOPHYSICS. A VARIATIONAL SPECIFICATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION IS GIVEN, ANDIT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEBRADFORD AND THAT OF THE USUAL DISTRIBUTIONS IS ROUGHLY ANALOGOUS TO THERELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEBESGUE AND RIEMANN INTEGRATION
