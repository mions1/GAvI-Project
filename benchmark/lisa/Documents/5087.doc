 ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DENSITY-OF-USE RANKING AND RAW USERANKING OF LIBRARY JOURNAL USE.REPORTS OF JOURNAL TITLES RANKED BY USE WITH SPACE AND COST INFORMATIONINCLUDED FOR EACH TITLE CAN PROVIDE A MEANS FOR MAKING CERTAIN OBJECTIVEJOURNAL COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. EACH TITLE CAN BE ASSESSED INRELATION TO THE OTHERS AND THE DATA FOR ALL TITLES CAN BE CUMULATED SO THATDECISIONS CAN BE MADE AT VARIOUS CUTOFF POINTS. SIMPLE RANKING OF TITLES BYRAW USE (RUR) MAY BE INADEQUATE AND SHOULD BE ADJUSTED BY SOME MEASURE TOALLOW FOR HOW MUCH OF THE TITLE IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER AT THE TIME OF THECOLLECTION OF THE USE DATA. IF THE RAW-USE FREQUENCY OF A TITLE IS DIVIDED BYTHE ACTUAL LINEAR SHELF SPACE OF THE TITLE'S FILE, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE'FREQUENCY IS OBTAINED. IF THESE FREQUENCIES ARE THEN RANKED, A 'DENSITY-OF-USERANK' (DUR) IS FORMED. SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUR AND DUR HAVE BEENANALYSED
