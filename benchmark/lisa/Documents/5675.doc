TATION ANALYSIS AND BIBLIOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CORE PERIODICALS.A REPORT OF THE PRELIMINARY STAGES OF A SPANISH STATE SPONSORED RESEARCHPROJECT. THE ANALYSIS COVERS CITATIONS OF PAPERS ON ANTINEOPLASTIC SUBSTANCESIN 2CANCER RESEARCH1 FROM 1976-79. A TOTAL OF 7,815 REFERENCES TO 576PERIODICALS CARRIED IN 284 PAPERS WAS OBTAINED, AND THE BRADFORD TECHNIQUEAPPLIED TO ASCERTAIN THE CORE PERIODICALS RECEIVING AN AVERAGE OF 1 CITATIONPER MONTH. A COMPARISON WAS THEN MADE BETWEEN CORE AND NON-CORE PERIODICALTHEMATIC COVERAGE OF 8 ANTINEOPLASTIC SUBSTANCES; AND THE QUANTITATIVEDIFFERENCE IN DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE 2 SETS OF PERIODICALS FOR GENERAL ANDSPECIFIC THEMATIC DISTRIBUTION ESTABLISHED. FULL DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF ALLCALCULATIONS MADE, AND RESULTS TABULATED. THE RESULTS OBTAINED SHOW THAT ONLYTHE CORE PERIODICALS CAN SATISFY THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIELD,AS REGARDS THEMATIC COVERAGE AND CITATION FREQUENCY
