 STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE AS SHOWN BY A LARGE-SCALE CITATIONANALYSIS.     TO COLLECT INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF SECONDARY SERVICES, ANANALYSIS OF 59,000 CITATIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES WAS CONDUCTED-11,000 TAKENFROM 300 MONOGRAPHS, AND 48,000 FROM 140 SERIALS, INCLUDING 47 HIGHLY CITEDTITLES AND 47 TAKEN AT RANDOM. LARGE DIFFERENCES WERE APPARENT BETWEENANALYSES OF REFERENES TAKEN FROM SERIALS AND THOSE FROM MONOGRAPHS, ANDSMALLER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANALYSES OF REFERENCES FROM HIGHLY CITED ANDRANDOMLY CHOSEN SERIALS. THERE WERE ALSO GREAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SUBJECTS;MOST OF THESE DIFFERENES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PLANNING OF SECONDARYSERVICES. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AREDEFICIENT IN THE RANGE OF FORMS OF MATERIAL THEY COVER, IN THE NUMBER ANDPOSSIBLY THE SELECTION OF SERIALS COVERED, IN THE SUBJECT SPREAD OF MATERIALOF POSSIBLE RELEVANCE, AND PROBABLY ALSO OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE MATERIAL ANDMATERIAL PUBLISHED IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES
