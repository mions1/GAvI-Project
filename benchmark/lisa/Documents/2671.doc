 ADMINISTRATION OF A SMALLER PUBLIC LIBRARY AUTHORITY AND THE ORGANISATIONOF THE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM.     IN THE NETHERLANDS LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH LESS THAN 30,000 INHABITANTS MAYORGANISE THEIR OWN LIBRARY SERVICE.

THE INTERESTS OFTHE LOCAL COMMUNITY CAN BE SERVED BY THE CREATION OF LIBRARY USERS' COMMITTEESIN EACH AREA
