EXING EXHAUSTIVITY AND THE COMPUTATION OF SIMILARITY MATRICES.     SOME OF THE AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES USED IN INFORMATION RETRIEVALDERIVE CLUSTERS OF DOCUMENTS FROM AN INTERMEDIATE SIMILARITY MATRIX, THECOMPUTATION OF WHICH INVOLVES COMPARING EACH OF THE DOCUMENTS IN THECOLLECTION WITH ALL OF THE OTHERS. IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUGGESTED THAT MANY OFTHESE COMPARISONS, SPECIFICALLY THOSE BETWEEN DOCUMENTS HAVING NO TERMS INCOMMON, MAY BE AVOIDED BY MEANS OF THE USE OF AN INVERTED FILE TO THE DOCUMENTCOLLECTION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE APPROACH WILL EFFECT REDUCTIONS IN THE NUMBEROF INTERDOCUMENT COMPARISONS ONLY IF THE DOCUMENTS ARE EACH INDEXED BY ALIMITED NUMBER OF INDEXING TERMS; IF EXHAUSTIVE INDEXING IS USED, MANYDOCUMENT PAIRS WILL BE COMPARED SEVERAL TIMES OVER AND THE COMPUTATION WILL BEGREATER THAN WHEN CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES ARE USED TO GENERATE THE SIMILARITYMATRIX
