PUTER-ASSISTED MECHANISTIC EVALUATION OF ORGANIC REACTIONS. 2. PERCEPTIONOF RINGS, AROMATICITY, AND TAUTOMERS.     NEW ALGORITHMS FOR THE PERCEPTION OF RINGS, AROMATICITY, AND TAUTOMERS WEREDEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CAMEO PROGRAM FOR COMPUTER-ASSISTEDMECHANISTIC EVALUATION OF ORGANIC REACTIONS. A NOTEWORTHY ASPECT OF THE RINGALGORITHM IS THAT ONLY RINGS BELONGING TO THE SMALLEST SET OF SMALLEST RINGSARE FOUND. RESULTS FOR REPRESENTATIVE MOLECULES ARE PRESENTED, AND RULES FORDETERMINING THE AROMATICITY/TAUTOMER STATUS OF RINGS, ESPECIALLY HETEROCYCLES,ARE DISCUSSED
