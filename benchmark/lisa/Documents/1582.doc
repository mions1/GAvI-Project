W SHALL THE LIBRARY APPROACH THE IMMIGRANTS?.     THE LIBRARY SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS IN DENMARK ARE GOVERNED BY THE GENERAL RULEOF EQUAL ACCESS TO LIBRARY SERVICES. FOR PRACTICAL REASONS, THIS MEANS THATPART OF THE SERVICE MUST BE CENTRALISED, VIZ. SELECTION, ACQUISITION ANDPREPARATION OF THE MATERIAL. GENTOFTE PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS SINCE 1970 HAD ACENTRAL COLLECTION OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AVAILABLE TO OTHER LIBRARIES. THECHOICE OF MATERIAL MUST BE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH PEOPLE KNOWLEDGEABLEABOUT THE GROUPS AND THEIR CONDITIONS IN THE NEW COUNTRY. THE SELECTION MUSTALSO REFLECT THE NEED, NOT ONLY FOR FICTIONAL, BUT ALSO FOR INFORMATIVELITERATURE BOTH ABOUT THE HOMELAND AND THE ADOPTED COUNTRY. MORE AUDIO-VISUALMATERIAL AND A BETTER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM ARE NECESSARY. THE EFFORTS OF THELOCAL LIBRARY CATERING FOR VERY SMALL GROUPS OF IMMIGRANTS MUST, APART FROMCOLLECTIONS OF REFERENCE WORKS AND CLASSICS, BE CONCENTRATED ON CONTACT WORKAND CULTURAL ARRANGEMENTS
