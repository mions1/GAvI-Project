ROBABILISTIC ALGORITHM FOR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR SEARCHING.     A DETERMINISTIC NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR SEARCH ALGORITHM IS MODIFIED SO THAT THEUSER CAN SPECIFY A MAXIMUM TOLERABLE LEVEL OF ERROR. THIS TOLERANCE ALLOWSCERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE ALGORITHM TO BE HANDLED PROBABILISTICALLY AND THIS, INTURN, ALLOWS AN IMPROVEMENT IN SEARCH SPEED DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE LEVEL OFERROR PERMITTED. THUS, SEARCH TIME CAN BE TRADED OFF AGAINST SEARCHEFFECTIVENESS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHM IS SUBSTANTIALLYFASTER THAN THE DETERMINISTIC, WITH ONLY A VERY SMALL LOSS IN RETRIEVALQUALITY
