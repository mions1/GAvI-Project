IA CONTROL REPORT WITHOUT PERSPECTIVES.     COMMENTS ON 2AUTOMATED MEDIA CONTROL IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, 1A JOINT REPORT BYTHE NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL LIBRARY WORKERS AND THE COMPUTERCOMMITTEE. THE WORKING PARTY ON PILOT PROJECTS DOES NOT DELINEATE LONG-TERMPERSPECTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE ITS PROPOSALS AS PARTOF A WHOLE. THE SWEDISH SITUATION OF 2 SEPARATE DATA SYSTEMS FOR SPECIAL ANDPUBLIC LIBRARIES, RESULTING IN DUPLICATION OF WORK AND UNDER-UTILISEDRESOURCES, MUST BE AVOIDED IN NORWAY; THE REPORT IS CRITICISED FOR NOTCONSIDERING COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES TOGETHER. ITALSO FAILS TO SPECIFY THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTERISATION ON LIBRARY STAFFS,BORROWERS AND FINANCE. THE COMMITTEE REGARDS ISSUE CONTROL AS THE ROUTINE MOSTREQUIRING COMPUTERISATION, BUT MANY PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES,SUCH AS OVERDUE RECALL WORK. EASILY-AMASSED STATISTICS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TOBUILD UP EXTRA WORK. SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS FROM THE REPORT ARE SELECTED FORDETAILED COMMENT
