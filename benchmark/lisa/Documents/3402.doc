 OF A MAXIMAL COMMON SUBGRAPH ALGORITHM IN THE AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OFTHE OSTENSIBLE BOND CHANGES OCCURRING IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS.     A FAST PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE LARGEST SUBSTRUCTURECOMMON TO THE REACTANT AND PRODUCT MOLECULES IN A CHEMICAL REACTION. ONCE THISSUBSTRUCTURE HAS BEEN FOUND, IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY AUTOMATICALLY THOSEBONDS IN THE REACTING MOLECULES WHICH HAVE APPARENTLY BEEN BROKEN OR FORMED INTHE COURSE OF THE REACTION; THESE BOND CHANGES COULD BE USED AS INDEXING TERMSFOR THE RETRIEVAL OF CHEMICAL REACTION INFORMATION
