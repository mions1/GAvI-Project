LIOGRAPHIC ACCESS FOR MICROFORM COLLECTIONS.     BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL TITLES IN MICROFORM COLLECTIONS IS APROBLEM. NEITHER THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NOR MOST MICROPUBLISHERS FULLYANALYSE THESE COLLECTIONS. INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES CANNOT AFFORD TO DO SO EITHER.BUT WITHOUT AUTHOR AND TITLE ACCESS, THESE COLLECTIONS ARE NOT VERY USEFUL.FULL ANALYTICS FOR MICROFORM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN CALLED FOR BUT NO EFFORTYET HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARIES ABANDON FULL CATALOGUING INFAVOUR OF INDEXING, USING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MICROPUBLISHERS. WHILE ANATIONAL INDEX TO THE CONTENTS OF MICROFORM COLLECTIONS WOULD BE BEST, ANALTERNATIVE FOR LOCAL LIBRARIES WOULD BE TO CREATE THEIR OWN COM INDEX
