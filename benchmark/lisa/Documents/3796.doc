PUTER STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF GENERIC CHEMICAL STRUCTURES IN PATENTS. 3.CHEMICAL GRAMMARS AND THEIR ROLE IN THE MANIPULATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES.     A SIMPLE TOPOLOGICAL CHEMICAL GRAMMAR IS DEVELOPED, AND ITS POSSIBLEAPPLICATIONS TO THE COMPUTER MANIPULATION OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES AREDISCUSSED. THE GENERATIVE AND RECOGNITIVE CAPABILITIES OF THE GRAMMAR AREILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES. CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING THE ROLE OF SUCHCAPABILITIES IN A GENERIC (MARKUSH) STRUCTURE SEARCH SYSTEM
