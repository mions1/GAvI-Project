OMPARATIVE STUDY OF RELEVANCE JUDGEMENTS BY USERS AND NON-USERS OF ASELECTIVE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION SERVICE.     EXTRACT FROM A BRAZILIAN DISSERTATION IN INFORMATION SCIENCE, DESCRIBING ANINVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT IN THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATIONDIVISION AT THE SAO PAULO INSTITUTE OF ATOMIC ENERGY, FOLLOWING THE CHANGEOVER IN 1974 FROM A MANUAL TO AN AUTOMATED SERVICE. A SUMMARY OF THEPRELIMINARY REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE RELATING TO RELEVANCE THEORIES, PREVIOUSSTUDIES, AND METHODOLOGY, IS PRESENTED. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY,BASED ON DOCUMENT TITLES, DEVELOPED FOR THIS STUDY TO RATE JUDGEMENTS ANDCOLLECT DATA. RESULTS ARE REPORTED IN FULL AND ANALYSED; THE CALCULATIONPROCEDURES ARE EXPLAINED AND DEMONSTRATED. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT USER ANDNON-USER JUDGEMENTS WERE LARGELY SIMILAR; DISAGREEMENTS WERE ATTRIBUTED TOINCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE USER AND OBJECTIVE NON-USER EVALUATIONCRITERIA. FINALLY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TITLES IN DETERMINING REL EVANCE WASCONSIDERED, AND THE CONCLUSION DRAWN THAT FREQUENCY OF PROFILE DESCRIPTORS INDOCUMENT TITLES DID NOT DIFFERENTIATE RELEVANT FROM NON-RELEVANT DOCUMENTS
