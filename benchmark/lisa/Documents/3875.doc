RITICAL SURVEY OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES.     EFFORTS MADE SINCE THE MID 19TH CENTURY TO PRODUCE ALPHABETICAL UNIONCATALOGUES OF ALL BOOKS WITHIN A UNIVERSITY HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY THEDIFFICULTY OF ACCESS TO SOME INSTITUTE LIBRARY STOCKS, BY INACCURATECATALOGUING IN INSTITUTE LIBRARIES AND BY THE QUESTIONABLE VALUE OF A CENTRALCATALOGUE WITHIN PURCHASING POLICY. SINCE 1970, HOWEVER, PROFESSIONAL OPINIONHAS BEEN INCREASINGLY IN FAVOUR OF UNION CATALOGUES IN UNIVERSITIES; WORK INTHIS FIELD AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES IS DESCRIBED AND EVALUATED THROUGH ANALYSISOF INTERLIBRARY LOAN FIGURES. THESE CATALOGUES SHOULD BE PRODUCED ONLY WHENCERTAIN CONDITIONS PREVAIL, E.G. WHEN INSTITUTE STOCK SUBJECT COVERAGE IS MUCHWIDER THAN THAT OF THE CENTRAL LIBRARY, WHEN ACCESS TO THE UNION CATALOGUE ISEASY AND WHEN THE CATALOGUE CAN BE PRODUCED WITHOUT DETRIMENT TO OTHER WORK
