USING A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK DERIVEDFROM RECENT FRENCH RESEARCH IN BIBLIOLOGY AND DOCUMENTOLOGY, THE DIALECTICS OFTHE WRITTEN WORD AND THE DOCUMENT ARE ANALYSED SEQUENTIALLY, BY COMPARING ANDCONTRASTING THE PROPERTIES OF EACH IN RELATION TO THEIR ESSENTIALCHARACTERISTICS; HOW THEY FUNCTION WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNICATIONCIRCUITS; MARXIST SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY; AND THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE.
