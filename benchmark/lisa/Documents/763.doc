LIOGRAPHY-THAT IS VERY INTERESTING! BUT WHY HAS IT NO PLACE IN THE SCHOOLCURRICULUM?.THE YAROSLAVL REGIONAL CHILDREN'S LIBRARY IS SUCCESSFULLY ORGANISINGLIBRARY/BIBLIOGRAPHY CLASSES FOR 1ST TO 8TH FORMERS, INCLUDING A QUARTERLYBIBLIOGRAPHY DAY, AIMING TO INTEREST SCHOOL CHILDREN IN BOOKS. BIBLIOGRAPHYDAY INCLUDES SONGS ABOUT FAMOUS LITERARY HEROES, QUESTIONS TO ANSWER FROMENCYCLOPAEDIAS, ETC. PLAYING WHILE LEARNING PROVED POSSIBLE, EVEN NECESSARY.BUT THE REGION HAS ONLY PARTIALLY ADOPTED THE SYLLABUS' 'FOUNDATIONS OFLIBRARY/BIBLIOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE'. IN 1979 THE GOVERNMENT PAPER ON IMPROVINGTHE RSFR (RUSSIAN SOVIET FEDERAL REPUBLIC) CHILDREN'S LIBRARY SERVICE STRESSEDTHE NEED FOR STUDIES ACCORDING TO A GIVEN SYLLABUS. BUT 275 OUT OF 365 SCHOOLSIN CHUVASHIYA AND 90% OF MOSCOW SCHOOLS AVOID THIS WORK. BIBLIOGRAPHICLITERACY IS OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE. RESPONSIBILITY RESTS WITH LIBRARIES ANDEDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS
