PUTER SIMULATION OF PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ORGANIC MOLECULES. 1.MOLECULAR SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION.A COMPUTER PROGRAM WHICH GENERATES MOLECULAR GEOMETRIES AND PERFORMS MOLECULARCALCULATIONS FOR ORGANIC MOLECULES IS PRESENTED. A LINEAR CODING METHODOLOGYUSED FOR INPUTTING THE MOLECULES IS ALSO DESCRIBED. THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OFA PROGRAM AIMED AT THE SIMULATION OF THE PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OFORGANIC MOLECULES
