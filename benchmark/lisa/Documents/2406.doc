AL REPORT OF THE PRECIS/TRANSLINGUAL PROJECT.     THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING PRECIS WITH EXTRA FACILITIES TO ENABLE IT TOFUNCTION AS A SYSTEM FOR SWITCHING INDEXING DATA BETWEEN 2 OR MORE NATURALLANGUAGES WAS INVESTIGATED. LEXICONS WERE ESTABLISHED IN 3 LANGUAGES, AND A'PIVOT FILE' CREATED TO LINK THEM. ROUTINES FOR SWITCHING INDEXING TERMS OUTOF A GIVEN SOURCE LANGUAGE AND INTO A CHOSEN TARGET LANGUAGE WERE DEVISED ANDSET DOWN IN THE FORM OF FLOW-CHARTS OR ALGORITHMS. USING THESE ALGORITHMS,PRECIS STRINGS WERE SWITCHED MAINLY BETWEEN ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND GERMAN.PROBLEMS OF TRANSLATION WERE SOLVED BY THE USE OF 'LEXICAL BLOCKS' AND THEADOPTION OF A SYSTEM OF CATEGORIES. MECHANISMS FOR THE AUTOMATIC PROVISION OFARTICLES IN FRENCH AND GERMAN STRINGS WERE DESIGNED. 2 METHODS OF PROVIDINGINFLECTED FORMS OF NOUNS BY ALGORITHM WERE TESTED IN GERMAN AND POLISH. THEUSE OF 'SUBSTITUTE' PHRASES IN PRECIS WAS INVESTIGATED, AND PROCEDURES FOR THEAUTOMATIC PROVISION AND CONSTRUCTION OF PHRASES IN A TARGET LANGUAGE WEREDEVISED. ALGORITHMS DESIGNED TO BUILD PREPOSITIONAL OR ADJECTIVAL PHRASES WERETESTED ON ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND GERMAN PRECIS STRINGS
