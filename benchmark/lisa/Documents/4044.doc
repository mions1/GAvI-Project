IRTY YEARS OF THE 2BIBLIOTEKAR1.     A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF ALMOST 30 YEARS OF 2BIBLIOTEKAR'S 1HISTORY.INADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES HAVE MEANT THAT AUTHORS FEES ARE NOT GENEROUS,AND THE QUALITY OF THE PUBLISHED MATERIAL SUFFERS. IT IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE TOIMPROVE THE JOURNAL'S LAYOUT, ALTHOUGH THE PRINTING FACILITIES AT THE CYRILAND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY ARE GRATEFULLY APPRECIATED. CERTAIN SUGGESTIONSSHOULD IMPROVE 2BIBLIOTEKAR'S 1QUALITY AND IMAGE, E.G. ARTICLES SHOULD BEPLANNED WELL IN ADVANCE BY THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY AND OTHERMAJOR LIBRARIES. FREELANCE CORRESPONDENTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SHOULD REPORTREGULARLY ABOUT LIBRARIES IN THEIR REGIONS. OTHER FREELANCE COLLABORATORS,WITH A GOOD COMMAND OF MODERN LANGUAGES, SHOULD PROVIDE REVIEWS OF FOREIGNPERIODICALS ON LIBRARIANSHIP AND DESIGNATE ARTICLES WORTHY OF FULL TRANSLATIONINTO BULGARIAN. A SPECIAL COMMISSION SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO SPECIFY2BIBLIOTEKAR'S1 STATUTE WHICH WOULD STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION AS THE ONLYJOURNAL CATERING FOR ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA
