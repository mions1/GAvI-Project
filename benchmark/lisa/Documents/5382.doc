RANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR END-USER OPERATION OF HETEROGENEOUSRETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. 1. DESIGN.ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO USE, ESPECIALLY BY END USERS,BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY AND COMPLEXITY. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONCERNED THECONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE AS A MEANS TO SIMPLIFY ACCESS TO,AND OPERATION OF, HETEROGENEOUS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DATABASES. THE INTERFACE ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE REQUESTS IN A COMMON LANGUAGE. THESEREQUESTS ARE TRANSLATED BY THE INTERFACE INTO THE APPROPRIATE COMMANDS FORWHATEVER SYSTEM IS BEING INTERROGATED. SYSTEM RESPONSES MAY ALSO BETRANSFORMED BY THE INTERFACE INTO A COMMON FORM BEFORE BEING GIVEN TO THEUSERS. THUS, THE NETWORK OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IS MADE TO LOOK LIKE A SINGLE'VIRTUAL' SYSTEM TO THE USER. THE INTERFACE ALSO PROVIDES INSTRUCTION ANDOTHER SEARCH AIDS FOR THE USER. PHILOSOPHY, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ANEXPERIMENTAL INTERFACE NAMED CONIT ARE DESCRIBED
