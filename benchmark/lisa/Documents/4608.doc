LIC LIBRARIES AND ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS IN COOPERATION.     THE ADULT EDUCATION MOVEMENT BUILT UP LIBRARIES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20THCENTURY, BUT WHEN THESE WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES, THECONNECTION BETWEEN THE ORGANISATIONS AND LIBRARIES LARGELY CEASED. CONSCIOUSOF THIS, OREBRO REGIONAL LIBRARY IN CONJUNCTION WITH 4 PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND 4ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS DREW UP A PROJECT SUPPORTED BY THE CULTURALCOUNCIL FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD OF 1 YEAR, WITH A PART-TIME LIBRARIAN ASORGANISER. THE AIM WAS TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH THE LEADERS, EXAMINE THEASSOCIATIONS' NEEDS AND HOW THE LIBRARY COULD MEET THEM. DIRECT CONTACT WITHTHE CLASS LEADERS PROVED DIFFICULT AND ADVANCE NOTICE OF BOOKS NEEDED HARD TOOBTAIN. STUDY VISITS TO THE LIBRARY WERE MADE BY SOME GROUPS, AND SPECIAL ANDBACKGROUND LITERATURE WAS LENT TO THE GROUPS ON LONG LOANS. CONCLUDES THAT THELIBRARIES OFTEN LACKED STAFF AND TIME TO TAKE THE NECESSARY INITIATIVES, ANDTHAT THE STUDY GROU P LEADER IS THE KEY TO ANY FRUITFUL CONTACT
