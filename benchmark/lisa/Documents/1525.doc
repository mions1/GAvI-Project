NTINUALLY CHANGING.     COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE BORAS LIBRARY HIGH SCHOOL, SWEDEN FOR 1979-80.THE CHANGING FORMS OF THE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND THE QUESTION OF ANEDUCATION FOR TUTOR LIBRARIANS ARE DISCUSSED. WHEN REVIEWING THE CAPACITY OFTHE SCHOOL IT IS CLEAR THAT IT HAS NOT RESPONDED WELL TO THE CHANGING LABOURMARKET, SOMETIMES PRODUCING OVER-, SOMETIMES UNDERCAPACITY. CRITICISES THEPLANS FOR SEVERAL SHORTER TRAINING COURSES AS THEY MIGHT REDUCE INTEREST INTHE 2-YEAR LIBRARIANSHIP COURSE. DISCUSSES ALSO WHETHER THE EDUCATION FORLIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE GENERAL WITH SPECIALISATION AFTER A FOUNDATION COURSE,AS THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES WANT, OR WHETHER SPECIALISED COURSES SHOULD BEAVAILABLE EARLIER, AND ARGUES FOR MORE LIBRARIANS WITH SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OFADMINISTRATION, INFORMATION WORK, AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES, WHICH CANNOT BEACQUIRED THROUGH COSTLY IN-SERVICE TRAINING
