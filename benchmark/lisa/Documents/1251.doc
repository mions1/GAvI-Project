APPROACH TO THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING.FOLLOWING A PREVIOUS STUDY CONCERNED WITH THE MONITORING OF INFORMATION FLOW,AIMS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF INFORMATION IN THE PROSECUTION OFENGINEERING PROJECTS. FOR EACH OF 3 PROJECTS THE BACKGROUND OF POTENTIALLYUSEFUL INFORMATION WAS EXPLORED AND COMPARED WITH THE INFORMATION ACTUALLYBEING USED. IN GENERAL NO VAST AMOUNT OF IMMEDIATELY USEFUL INFORMATION WASFOUND, MUCH OF THE INFORMATION USED DERIVING FROM THE INDIVIDUAL ENGINEER'SOWN TRAINING AND RESOURCES. THE INFORMATION FLOW WAS REGARDED AS ADEQUATE FORTHE PRACTICAL PURPOSES OF THE PROJECTS. HOWEVER, AWARENESS OF RESEARCHINFORMATION POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR THE LONG RANGE PLANNING WAS LIMITED, THEMAIN OBSTACLES TO INFORMATION FLOW OF THIS TYPE BEING MANAGEMENT ATTITUDES ANDORGANISATIONAL CONSTRAINTS
