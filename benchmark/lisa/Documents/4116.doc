 LIFE IN THE OLD VARDE.     GIVES A PORTRAIT OF VARDE PUBLIC LIBRARY, DUE TO TAKE POSSESSION OF A NEW MAINLIBRARY IN THE CENTRAL TOWN SQUARE. VARDE HAS BEEN IN LIBRARY UNION WITH 2OTHER LOCAL AUTHORITIES SINCE 1973, SERVING A TOTAL OF 28,000 INHABITANTS WITH1 MOBILE AND 10 BRANCH LIBRARIES. THE NEW LIBRARY WILL HAVE 1500 SQ.M. WITHROOM FOR EXPANSION, MAKING A MUSIC LIBRARY POSSIBLE EVENTUALLY. INTERVIEWS THEMAYOR AND CHAIRMAN OF THE UNION LIBRARY, WHO IS PREPARED TO ALLOCATE MOREMONEY TO THE SERVICE IF DEMAND INCREASES. THE MOBILE LIBRARY HAS BEEN VERYSUCCESSFUL IN AREAS TOO SPARSELY POPULATED TO SUSTAIN BRANCHES. PARTY POLITICSIS FORTUNATELY ABSENT AMONG POLITICIANS DEALING WITH LIBRARIES. THEY MUST,HOWEVER, HAVE THE FINAL RESPONSIBILITY IN BOOK SELECTION, WHILE INTERFERING ASLITTLE AS POSSIBLE. INTERVIEWS THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN. SINCE THE UNION, SPACEPROBLEMS HAVE MOUNTED, AND WITH THE NEW LIBRARY, LOANS ARE EXPECTED TOINCREASE WITHOUT EXTRA ALLOCATION FOR STAFF. WOULD LIKE TO SE E ANOTHER MOBILELIBRARY REPLACE SOME OF THE BRANCHES WHICH HAVE FEW LOANS. THE MOBILE LIBRARYHAS BROUGHT NEW READERS TO THE MAIN LIBRARY. HOWEVER, THE USE OF 1 OF THEBRANCHES VISITED WAS SUCH THAT A MOBILE LIBRARY COULD NOT REPLACE IT
