EW CONCEPT FOR THE DESIGN OF A FLEXIBLE OFFICE SYSTEM.     PRESENTS OFFICE AUTOMATION SYSTEMS AS AN APPLICATION OF MICROPROCESSOR BASEDSYSTEMS. THE SMALL SIZE, LOW COST, AND REASONABLY HIGH POWER OF THESE SYSTEMSENABLED THEIR USE IN AUTOMATING SOME OFFICE TASKS. PRESENTS A GENERALDESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL MICROPROCESSOR BASED OFFICE AUTOMATION SYSTEM, THENDISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS ARISING IN THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND USE OF SUCHSYSTEMS. PROPOSES A SCHEME FOR PARTITIONING AND MODULARISING THE HARDWARE ANDSOFTWARE OF THE SYSTEM, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE SOLUTION OF SOMEPROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY, PORTABILITY AND SYSTEM EXTENSIBILITY. THE PROPOSEDSYSTEM CAN BE USED AS A UNIVERSAL BASIC CORE ON WHICH ONE CAN EASILY BUILDLARGER WORD PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THE USER CAN, BY HIMSELF, EXTEND HIS SYSTEM BYUSING THE SAME WORD PROCESSING LANGUAGE HE USES EVERYDAY BECAUSE OF ITSSPECIAL PROPERTIES PRESENTED HERE. THE SYSTEM IS ALSO SIMPLY RECONFIGURABLE ATTHE WILL OF THE USER TO EXACTLY FI T HIS NEEDS AT ANY TIME
