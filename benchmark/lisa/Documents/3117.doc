CTRON LATTICE SCATTERING TECHNIQUE FOR CITATION ANALYSIS AND EVALUATING THEIMPACT OF RESEARCH PAPERS.     INTRODUCES A PHYSICAL MODEL FOR MEASURING THE IMPACT OF RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONBASED ON SCATTERING OF ELECTRONS BY THE LATTICE ATOMS. DESCRIBES SCATTERING ASA STOCHASTIC PROCESS AND ADOPTS AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION IN WHICH LATTICE ATOMSAND ELECTRONS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY A SYSTEM OF RESEARCH PAPERS AND POTENTIALCITERS RESPECTIVELY. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ABOVE MODEL, THE AUTHORS HAVEMADE A NUMBER OF SIMPLIFICATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND DEVELOPED AN ABSORPTIONINDEX ACTIVITY TO BE USED AS AN INDEX FOR MEASURING RELATIVE IMPACT OF VARIOUSCONTRIBUTIONS IN A GIVEN FIELD OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
