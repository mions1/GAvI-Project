OLOGICAL MODELS AND INFORMATION USER VIEWS.     THE DESIGN OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIRES INFORMATION CONTENT TO BE DEFINEDINDEPENDENTLY FROM THE HANDLING OF INFORMATION. THE INFOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVESTRESSES THIS AND IS BASED ON A SEMANTICAL MODEL RATHER THAN A REAL-WORLDMODEL.

THE HERMENEUTICAL CIRCLE (INFOLOGICAL MEANING IN HERMENEUTICALTEXTS) IS DEMONSTRATED, AND THE INFOLOGICAL AND DATALOGICAL USER VIEWS AREDESCRIBED AND COMPARED
