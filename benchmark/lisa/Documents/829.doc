ASURVEY OF USER PHOTOCOPYING PRACTICE SUGGESTED THAT CIRCULATION LIMITED TOJOURNALS OVER 5 YEARS OLD MIGHT RESULT IN A 90% INCREASE IN PHOTOCOPYING, ANDCIRCULATION SURVEY WERE USED TO PREDICT A 45% DECREASE IN CIRCULATION. RESULTSOF IMPLEMENTING A LIMITED CIRCULATION POLICY WERE A 41% CIRCULATION DECREASEAND A 136% INCREASE IN PHOTOCOPYING. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTION ANDRESULTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EFFECT OF DUPLICATE COPY SUBSCRIPTIONS ANDBY PROVISION OF CONVENIENT PHOTOCOPY FACILITIES
