CESSFUL CONVERSION IN MOSS.     MOSS LIBRARY, NORWAY, WAS PURPOSE-BUILT IN 1927, BUT UNTIL 1980 OTHER LOCALGOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS OCCUPIED ALL BUT THE GROUND FLOOR. IN 1978 IT BECAMEPOSSIBLE TO CONVERT THE WHOLE BUILDING FOR LIBRARY USE. THE LIBRARY NOWOCCUPIES 1292 SQ.M. ON 3 FLOORS. THE BASEMENT HOUSES STACKS, A STUDY-ROOM ANDA STORY-HOUR ROOM. LENDING DEPARTMENTS OCCUPY THE GROUND FLOOR, AND READINGAND PERIODICALS ROOMS THE 1ST FLOOR. A TOWER WING HOUSES THE LIBRARIAN'SOFFICE, LOCAL COLLECTION AND MICROFILM EQUIPMENT. WHILE EXTRA SPACE FOREXHIBITIONS, STUDY PLACES AND A MUSIC DEPARTMENT WOULD BE VALUABLE, THECONVERSION IS FELT TO BE A SUCCESS BY BOTH STAFF AND PUBLIC
