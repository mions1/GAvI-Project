D FOR PRIMARY PERIODICALS AS DETERMINED BY SDI.AN INVESTIGATION OF PRIMARY PERIODICALS THAT APPEARED IN REFERENCES SELECTEDFROM CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS CONDENSATES WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE OUTPUT FOR ABOUT2,000 PROFILES. FREQUENCY LISTS, IN ALPHABETICAL AND RANK ORDER, WERE CREATEDFOR THE DATA OBTAINED IN THE COURSE OF ROUTINE PROCESSING OF 2 VOLUMES: 86 AND89. IN BOTH ISSUES, A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF JOURNALS, FOR EXAMPLE, 212AND 220 OUT OF 6,209 AND 7,039 TITLES, RESPECTIVELY, SUPPLIED 50% OF THERELEVANT PAPERS FOR SDI USERS. THE METHOD IS DESCRIBED, AND THE RESULTS ARECOMPARED WITH THE CASSI LIST OF JOURNALS MOST FREQUENTLY CITED IN CHEMICALABSTRACTS
