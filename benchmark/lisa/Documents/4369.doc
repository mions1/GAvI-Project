 SYNERGISM OF USER NEEDS, SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS.     USER PERCEPTION OF DATA IMPORTANCE AND THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF HARDWAREAND STORAGE DEVICES WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS. ARETRIEVAL SYSTEM'S FUNCTIONS ARE ULTIMATELY DICTATED BY DATA BASE DESIGN.EARLY ON-LINE SYSTEMS WERE DESIGNED FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION LIMITED TOCITATIONS ONLY USING SEQUENTIAL FILES. NOW FULL TEXT INFORMATION, NUMERICINFORMATION, AND MANIPULATIVE SYSTEMS ARE BEING PERCEIVED BY A CLASS OF USERSNOT INTERESTED IN SPECIALISED VOCABULARY SKILLS. THESE USERS ARE PLACINGDEMANDS THAT WILL REQUIRE SOPHISTICATED INTERNAL TECHNOLOGY, IMPROVED ANDEXPANDED STORAGE CAPABILITY, MORE SOPHISTICATED FILE STRUCTURE, ANDTRANSPARENT DATA MANIPULATIVE DEVICES. THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF THESE DEMANDSWILL BRING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW GENERATION OF MULTITIERED DATA BASESTHAT ALLOW USERS AT ALL SKILL LEVELS TO APPROACH THEM. THE POINT IS THAT, ASTHE USER'S NEED FOR TYPES OF DATA TO BE RETRIEVED CHANGES, SO MUST THE DATABASE TECHNOLOGY CHANGE. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS
