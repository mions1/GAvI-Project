PARATIVE ANALYSIS OF HARDWARE VERSUS SOFTWARE TEXT SEACH.     PRESENTS A HYBRID APPROACH TO DATA BASE TEXT SEARCHING, USING THE BESTFEATURES OF INVERSION AND STREAMING SEARCHING TECHNIQUES TO MINIMISE DATA FLOWAND OBTAIN COMPLETE FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITY. THE QUERY IS BROKEN INTO 2 PARTSBASED UPON THE EXISTENCE OF TERMS (OFFENSIVE TERMS) HAVING LEADING OR IMBEDDED'DON'T CARES'. THOSE DOCUMENTS SATISFYING THE PART OF THE QUERY WITHOUTOFFENSIVE TERMS ARE IDENTIFIED VIA INVERSION. THESE DOCUMENTS ARE ACCESSED ANDTHE OFFENSIVE TERMS ARE SEARCHED FOR VIA STREAMING. DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OFTHE 1ST SET OF SIMULATION RUNS IN WHICH THE EXPERIMENTERS PERFORMEDSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON MACHINE PROCESSING POWER AND % OF TERMS WITH LEADINGVARIABLE-LENGTH 'DON'T CARES'
