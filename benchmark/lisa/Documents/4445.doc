RNALS READ BY ACRL ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, 1973 AND 1978.     A STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO IDENTIFY THE AMOUNT AND KINDS OF PROFESSIONALJOURNAL READING BEING DONE BY ACRL (ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE AND RESEARCHLIBRARIES) ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS, WITH DATA DRAWN FROM 2 SEPARATE SURVEYS MADEOVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO A SAMPLE OF ACRLMEMBERS IN 1973 AND AGAIN IN 1978, WHICH ASCERTAINED HOW MANY JOURNALS THEYWERE READING REGULARLY AND WHAT THE TITLES OF THOSE JOURNALS WERE.ILLUSTRATIONS PROVIDE A COMPARISON OF MOST FREQUENTLY READ TITLES FOR 1973 TO1978, WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF READER RESPONSE FOR EACH TITLE. FOR BOTH YEARSSURVEYED, ACRL ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY 7 JOURNALS READ ON AREGULAR BASIS. A SEPARATE ANALYSIS OF THE 1978 DATA INDICATED THAT 7 OF THETITLES CITED AS BEING READ ACCOUNTED FOR 80% OF THE JOURNAL READING. AS HADBEEN THE CASE IN 1973, MORE THAN 9 IN 10 OF THESE ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS WEREREGULAR READERS OF COLLEGE & RESEARCH LIBRAR IES. HOWEVER, SEVERAL OTHERTITLES HEAVILY CITED IN 1973 LOST READERSHIP AMONG ACRL MEMBERS DUE TO THEDRAMATIC APPEARANCE OF THE JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP
