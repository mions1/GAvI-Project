PARATIVE TERMINAL REALIZATIONS WITH ALPHA-GEOMETRIC CODING.     IT IS CONSIDERED DESIRABLE THAT A VIDEOTEX SYSTEM SHOULD BE CAPABLE OFTRANSMITTING BOTH HIGH AND LOW QUALITY GRAPHICS AND TERMINALS SHOULD BE ABLETO PRODUCE AN IMAGE FROM EITHER TYPE OF SIGNAL ACCORDING TO THE TERMINALDESIGN. SYSTEMS CONFIGURATIONS ARE SHOWN TO ILLUSTRATE TERMINALS OF VARIOUSLEVELS OF SOPHISTICATION. IT IS THOUGHT THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE COSTDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF SOPHISTICATION WILL NOT BE GREAT. REFERENCEIS MADE TO THE CAPABILITIES OF TELIDON SOFTWARE FLEXIBILITY
