LIZATION OF CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) DATA BASES. APPLICATION FORTHE IDC-INORGANICA-DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM.A METHOD IS DEVELOPED DESCRIBING THE ECONOMIC UTILISATION OF THE CHEMICALABSTRACTS SERVICE DATA BASES; CA CONDENSATES AND CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SUBJECTINDEX ALERT IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT THE DATA BASE OF THEIDC-INORGANICA-DOCUMENTATIONSYSTEM BUILT UP TO MEET THE PECULIARITIES OFINORGANIC CHEMISTRY. THE METHOD CONSISTS OF EDP-PROGRAMS AND PROCESSES ATWHICH SPECIAL AUTHORITY FILES FOR CODED COMPOUND AND SUBJECT ENTRIES PLAY ANIMPORTANT ROLE. ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE METHOD IS THAT THE INTELLECTUALEFFORT NECESSARY TO CREATE SUCH A DATA BASE IS REDUCED TO A MINIMUM
