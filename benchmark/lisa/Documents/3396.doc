ASSOCIATIVE FILE STORE USING FRAGMENTS FOR RUN-TIME INDEXING ANDCOMPRESSION.     AN ASSOCIATIVE FILE STORE (AFS) IS OFFERED AS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO CURRENTPROBLEMS WITH ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. IT WOULD BE ASINGLE-INSTRUCTION MULTIPLE-DATA STREAM MACHINE, DEDICATED TO ASSOCIATIVE FILESEARCHING WHILE OVERALL CONTROL OF THE SYSTEM WOULD BE ENTRUSTED TO ACONVENTIONAL SINGLE-INSTRUCTION SINGLE-DATA STREAM MACHINE. THE ASSOCIATIVEPARALLEL PROCESSOR (A MAJOR COMPONENT OF AFS) WOULD SUPPORT 'ON-THE-FLY' FILESEARCHING AND SIMPLIFY THE INDEXING PROBLEMS OF DIRECTLY ACCESSING SINGLERECORDS TO THAT OF INDICATING THE MOST PROBABLE SCAN BLOCK FOR A HIGH RECALLOF MATCHING RECORDS. INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS SUGGEST THAT AFS WOULD OUT-PERFORMCONVENTIONAL FILE STORES BY OVER 2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, BE SIMPLE TO MAINTAIN,AND OFFER FULL FREE-TEXT RETRIEVAL FLEXIBILITY
