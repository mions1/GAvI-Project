 IMPACT OF WARFARE ON THE RATE OF INVENTION' A TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OFUNITED STATES ACTIVITY.     THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IS GENERALLY THOUGHT TO SHIFT THE FIELDS IN WHICH RESEARCHIS CONDUCTED. AS A RESULT, MILITARY CONFLICT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CREDITEDWITH BEING THE CATALYST WHICH HAS CAUSED DECISIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. ITIS ALSO GENERALLY SUGGESTED THAT WARFARE HAS A SYSTEMATIC IMPACT ON THEINTENSITY OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY. MOST SCHOLARS HAVE CLAIMED THAT WARS INCREASEINVENTIVENESS, ALTHOUGH A FEW ARGUE THAT CONFLICT IS A HINDERANCE TO RESEARCH.THIS QUESTION HAS NOT RECEIVED EXTENSIVE EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION. USING US DATA,A BASIC PATTERN IS REPEATEDLY OBSERVED. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF AWAR, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN INVENTIVENESS, WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY AMARKED SURGE. THE AVERAGE NET RESULT IS A VIRTUAL NEGATION OF THE 2 TRENDS
