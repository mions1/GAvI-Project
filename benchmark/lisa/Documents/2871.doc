BARDY' THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SYSTEM FOR COLLECTIVE CATALOGUING ANDBIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION.     DISCUSSES THE REASONS BEHIND THE SUSPENSION OF THE PROJECTED NETWORK INLOMBARDY, BEGUN IN 1975 AND DISRUPTED IN 1977. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THESTRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM DRAWN UP BY THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION, THEORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF EXISTING LIBRARIES AS INFORMATION ANDCATALOGUING CENTRES, AND THE TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT INTRODUCED. WITH THE CHANGEOF GOVERNMENT IN 1977, THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED FOR RE-EVALUATION, AND UP TO1980 NO DECISION HAD BEEN REACHED. THE INHERENT DEFECTS OF THE SYSTEM AREANALYSED, TO SHOW HOW THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION MADE A FUNDAMENTAL ERROR INESTABLISHING A DECENTRALISED SYSTEM WITHOUT OVERHAULING EXISTING SERVICES TOENSURE ADEQUATE COOPERATION BETWEEN CATALOGUING CENTRES. THE IMMEDIATE CAUSESOF SUSPENSION WERE INCOMPATABILITY OF THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM CHOSEN WITH MARC,AND FAILURE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES TO MAINTAIN ROUTINE CATALOGUINGACTIVITIES. EMPH ASISES THE NECESSITY FOR BASIC REORGANISATION OF NATIONALLIBRARY SERVICES PRIOR TO SCHEMES FOR AUTOMATION AND COOPERATION
