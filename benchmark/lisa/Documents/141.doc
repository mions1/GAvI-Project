ATION AND CO-CITATION INDICATORS OF A PHASED IMPACT OF THE BCS THEORY INTHE PHYSICS OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY.AN INTELLECTUAL ACCOUNT OF THE PHYSICS OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY WAS COMPARED WITHCITATION AND COCITATION DATA DURING 2 HISTORICAL PERIODS THAT COINCIDED WITHTHE INTRODUCTION OF ITS CENTRAL EXPLANATORY THEORY (BCS). INVESTIGATES THECOCITATION DATA THROUGH FACTOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS GIVE PRELIMINARY SUPPORT TO AHYPOTHESIS THAT DISTINGUISHES IMPACT PHRASES IN THE EFFECT OF THE THEORY ONTHE COGNITIVE ORGANISATION OF THE SPECIALITY. IT IS ALSO OBSERVED THATCITATION AND COCITATION DATA ARE SEPARATE TYPES OF INFORMATION WHICH, UNDERSOME HISTORICAL CONDITIONS, GIVE DIFFERING RESULTS
