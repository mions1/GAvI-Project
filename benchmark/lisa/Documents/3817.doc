 UTILIZATION OF AGRINDEX IN THE CARIBBEAN.     A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE INFORMATION HABITS AND NEEDS OFTHE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCHES IN THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES OF THE CARIBBEANREGION WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE USE OF AGRINDEX. THE SURVEY REVEALEDTHAT AGRINDEX IS USED BY AND KNOWN TO ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS ANDPOSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS ARE DISCUSSED. FROM ALL INDICATIONS IT SEEMS THATTHERE IS A NEED FOR AN INFORMATION SERVICE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ABSTRACTS ANDREVIEWS OF REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL LITERATURE AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON RESEARCHIN PROGRESS. TWO RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE; ONE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A USEREDUCATION PROGRAMME WHICH WOULD ENSURE WIDER USE OF AGRINDEX AND THE SECONDFOR A SUB-REGIONAL CO-ORDINATION CENTRE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES
