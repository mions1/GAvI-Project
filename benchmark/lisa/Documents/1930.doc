IMIZING THE EVALUATION OF CALCULUS EXPRESSIONS IN A RELATIONAL DATABASESYSTEM.     THE TGR EXPERIMENTAL RELATIONAL DATA BASE SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED. ITS USE OFMICROPROGRAMMED DATA BASE PRIMITIVES AND OPTIMISATION FEATURES IS INTENDED TOINCREASE THE SPEED OF RETRIEVAL. THE FEEDBACK-OPTIMISATION STRATEGY ISILLUSTRATED USING 2-VARIABLE EXPRESSIONS AND ARBITRARY (MULTI-VARIABLE)EXPRESSIONS. THE USE OF FILTERS AND THEIR RULES FOR CONSTRUCTION AREDESCRIBED, AND ILLUSTRATED IN THE CONJUNCTIVE NORMAL FORM. TGR IS BRIEFLYCOMPARED WITH DAMAS, AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION USING THE BCLP LANGUAGE DESCRIBED.STATISTICS ON PERFORMANCE SHOW THAT THE FEEDBACK-OPTIMISATION IS BEST SUITEDFOR QUERIES INVOLVING MANY RELATIONS AND PERFORMANCE IS POOR WITH LARGERELATIONS, IT CANNOT THEREFORE BE USED AS A STAND-ALONE OPTIMISATION METHOD.MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO SELECT THE RIGHT OPTIONS
