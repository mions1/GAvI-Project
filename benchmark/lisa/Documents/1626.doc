LICATION RATE AS A FUNCTION OF LABORATORY SIZE IN THREE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHINSTITUTIONS.     IN 3 BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A SINGLELABORATORY SIZE AT WHICH THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS PER SCIENTIST IS MAXIMALOR MINIMAL. IN A SCATTERGRAM OF THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS OF A LABORATORYAGAINST LABORATORY SIZE, THE HORIZONTAL COORDINATE MEASURES THE NUMBER OFSCIENTISTS IN A LABORATORY, THE VERTICAL AXIS MEASURES THE NUMBER OFPUBLICATIONS FROM THE LABORATORY (COUNTING EACH PUBLICATION ONCE REGARDLESS OFTHE NUMBER OF AUTHORS), AND EACH LABORATORY IS REPRESENTED BY ONE POINT.SCATTERGRAMS FOR THE ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY (NEW YORK), THE NATIONAL INSTITUTEFOR MEDICAL RESEARCH (LONDON), AND THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (BETHESDA)ARE EACH DESCRIBED WELL BY A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE ORIGIN. THE SLOPES OFTHE LINES FOR THE THREE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. IN THESELABORATORIES, RANGING IN SIZE FROM 1 TO 46 SCIENTISTS, ONE ADDITIONALSCIENTIST  INCREASES THE EXPECTED ANNUAL NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS OF ALABORATORY BY APPROXIMATELY 1.1, REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THE LABORATORY
