OMATED ADDITIVE MODELING TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO THERMOCHEMICAL PROPERTYESTIMATION.AUTOMATED ADDITIVE MODELING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO THE ESTIMATION OFHEATS OF VAPORISATION. COMPUTER-READABLE REPRESENTATIONS OF CHEMICALSTRUCTURES WERE ANALYSED ALGORITHMICALLY TO DERIVE STRUCTURAL GROUPINGS TO BEUSED IN THE MODEL. THESE WERE THEN INPUT AS VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE REGRESSIONANALYSES, WHICH GAVE THE GROUP CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE USED IN ESTIMATION. THEMETHOD GAVE GOOD ESTIMATIONS FOR VARIOUS STRUCTURAL TYPES AND COULD BE APPLIEDTO A VARIETY OF THERMOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES
