 USE OF TRIGRAM ANALYSIS FOR SPELLING ERROR DETECTION.     WORK PERFORMED UNDER THE SPELLING ERROR DETECTION CORRECTION PROJECT(SPEEDCOP) SUPPORTED BY NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) AT CHEMICALABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) TO DEVISE EFFECTIVE AUTOMATIC METHODS OF DETECTING ANDCORRECTING MISSPELLINGS IN SCHOLARLY AND SCIENTIFIC TEXT IS DESCRIBED. THEINVESTIGATION WAS APPLIED TO 50,000 WORD/MISSPELLING PAIRS COLLECTED FROM 6DATASETS (2CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NOTES, BIOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS, CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1,AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY PRIMARY JOURNAL KEYBOARDING, 2INFORMATION SCIENCEABSTRACTS1, AND DISTRIBUTED ON-LINE EDITING (DOLE) (A CAS INTERNAL DATASETESPECIALLY SUITED TO SPELLING ERROR STUDIES). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TODETERMINE THE UTILITY OF TRIGRAM ANALYSIS IN THE AUTOMATIC DETECTION AND/ORCORRECTION OF MISSPELLINGS
