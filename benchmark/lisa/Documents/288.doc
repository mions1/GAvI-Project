ISTRATION-IDENTIFICATION OF CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS BASED ON LATTICE ANDEMPIRICAL FORMULA.DATA FILES CONTAINING INFORMATION ON SOLID-STATE MATERIALS ARE EXPANDINGRAPIDLY. EACH YEAR SEVERAL THOUSAND NEW MATERIALS ARE CHARACTERISED BY X-RAYDIFFRACTION TECHNIQUES. CONSEQUENTLY, COMPUTER PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPEDTO REGISTER MATERIALS ENTERING LARGE DATA FILES. REGISTRATION BASED ON LATTICEPARAMETERS AND EMPIRICAL FORMULA IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE. THE LATTICE ISUNIQUELY REPRESENTED BY THE REDUCED CELL AND THE ELEMENTS IN THE FORMULA AREUNIQUELY SPECIFIED BY PRIME NUMBERS. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN APPLIED FOR SEVERALYEARS TO REGISTER NEW MATERIALS FOR THE CAMBRIDGE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC DATA FILEWHICH CONTAINS DATA ON MORE THAN 25,000 COMPOUNDS CONTAINING ORGANIC CARBON.THE METHOD IS NOW BEING ADAPTED TO REGISTER MATERIALS FOR THE NBS CRYSTAL DATAFILE
