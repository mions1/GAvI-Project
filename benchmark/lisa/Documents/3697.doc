 EFFECTS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION ON STAFF AND READERS MUST BE INVESTIGATED.     RESEARCH HAS CONCENTRATED ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION ANDNEGLECTED THE SOCIOLOGICAL ASPECTS, SO THAT OPINION ON THE POSITIVE ANDNEGATIVE EFFECTS IS SHARPLY DIVIDED. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF AUTOMATION IS TOINCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBRARY PROCEDURES; SERVICE CHANGES ARE STILLREGARDED AS SIDE-EFFECTS. AUTOMATION'S VALUE MUST BE JUDGED IN TERMS OF THEAVERAGE NON-ACADEMIC READER. THE TIME SAVED FOR STAFF THROUGH AUTOMATION OFROUTINE PROCEDURES MUST BE USED FOR READER-ORIENTED ACTIVITIES, FOR WHICHFURTHER STAFF TRAINING SHOULD BE PROVIDED. THE RESULTS OF EXPERIENCES IN THISFIELD FROM LIBRARIES ABROAD SHOULD BE STUDIED CAREFULLY
