 CONSERVATION OF LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICALCONDITIONS' THE PROBLEMS OF THE INCREASED DANGERS OF DAMAGE AND DECAY IN AREASOF HIGH TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY.     THE GENERAL POINT IS STRESSED THAT LIBRARY COLLECTIONS IN TROPICAL ANDSUB-TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME DANGERS AS THOSE IN MODERATECLIMATE ZONES; BUT IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL THESE DANGERS ARE INCREASED,SOME OF THEM DRAMATICALLY, IN WARM DAMP CLIMATES. IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICALCLIMATES THERE IS THE THREAT OF DAMAGE BY INSECTS OF A NATURE AND TO AN EXTENTTHAT IS UNKNOWN IN MODERATE CLIMATE ZONES AND FINALLY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TOCHANGE THIS SITUATION FUNDAMENTALLY BY ANY CONSERVATION OR RESTORATIONMEASURES, AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT AN EXPENDITURE THAT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC INPRESENT TERMS OF MANPOWER AND ENERGY
