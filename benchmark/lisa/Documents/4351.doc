REASING INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PRECISION.     ISOLATES 6 PAIRS OF INTER-RELATED FACTORS (INFORMATION AND USER, DOCUMENT ANDSEARCH DESCRIPTIONS, DESCRIPTOR AND SUBJECT WORD, OBJECT AND PROCESS, HIGHER-AND LOWER-RANK CONCEPTS, AND SELECTION AND REDUCTION), SOME OF WHICH MAYINTERFERE WITH SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PRECISION(ESPECIALLY IN COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS). TO ELIMINATE SUCH INTERFERENCE, PROPOSESTHAT' A FORMULA SPECIFYING INFORMATION NEED MORE PRECISELY SHOULD BEINTRODUCED; WHILE INDEXING, SUBJECT (RATHER THAN DOCUMENT) CONTENT SHOULD BEDESCRIBED; CONCEPT CHARACTERISTICS, RATHER THAN UNIFIED KEY WORDS, SHOULD BEUSED; PROCESS-ORIENTED WORDS SHOULD BE USED TO DESCRIBE CHANGES IN TIME;HIGHER-RANK CONCEPTS SHOULD BE USED ONLY IF THEY ADEQUATELY COVER ALLSUBORDINATED CONCEPTS; AND ELEMENTS FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SHOULD NOT BEMIXED WITH THOSE AIMED AT CONTENT DESCRIPTION
