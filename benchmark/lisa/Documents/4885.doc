COSTING ALTERNATIVE PATTERNS FOR COM-FICHE CATALOGUES.     AN ALGEBRAIC MODEL RELATING CATALOGUE COSTS TO THE NUMBER OF EXISTING TITLES,NEW TITLES AND TITLES PROCESSED IS DEVELOPED. THE NUMBER OF TITLES PROCESSEDIS THEN RELATED TO THE CUMULATION AND CONSOLIDATION FREQUENCIES SO THAT THEEFFECT OF DIFFERENT CUMULATION PATTERNS CAN BE CALCULATED. THIS SHOWS THATANNUAL CONSOLIDATION IS SENSIBLE IN SEVERAL SITUATIONS. VARIATIONS IN OTHERFACTORS ARE NOT CONSIDERED EXPLICITLY BUT A COMPUTER SIMULATION MODEL ISDESCRIBED WHICH COULD BE USED TO INVESTIGATE ANY SET OF REASONABLEALTERNATIVES
