ANTIC LIMITATION IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION.THE BASIC PROBLEM IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL IS THAT THE RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE IS NOTPROPERLY ADAPTED TO THAT OF THE AUTHOR. MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION, WHEREWORDS WITH THE SAME ROOT ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN THE INVERTED FILE, IS A GOODELIMINATOR OF NOISE AND INFORMATION LOSS, PROVIDING HIGH RECALL BUT LOWPRECISION. PRECISION CAN BE INCREASED THROUGH THE PROCESS DESCRIBED, WHEREBYSEMANTIC INFORMATION FROM THE MORPHOLOGICAL PERIPHERY OF THE ROOTS CAN BEOBTAINED, WHICH CAN BE VERY RELEVANT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. THE PROCESSINVOLVES RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH DERIVATIVE SUFFIXES, PREFIXES AND COMPOSITETERMS, PLUS THE USE OF LINK OPERATORS; VARIOUS FORMULATION POSSIBILITIES AREILLUSTRATED. AUTOMATIC INCLUSION OF AUTONOMOUS WORD STRUCTURES IS ALLOWED
