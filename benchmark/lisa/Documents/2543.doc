UDENTS CRITICISE THE SITUATION CONCERNING TRAINING AT STUTTGART LIBRARYSCHOOL.     REPORT OF DISCUSSION AT A WEEKEND SEMINAR, STUTTGART, JAN 81. MANY STUDENTSHAVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES IN FINDING ACCOMMODATION BUT,COMPARED WITH OTHER COURSES, FEW DROP OUT AND STUDENT-STAFF RELATIONSHIPS AREGOOD. LIBRARIANSHIP STUDIES SHOULD DEVELOP CRITICAL FACULTIES AND THE ABILITYTO MAKE CONTACT WITH READERS. THE LIBRARY MUST BECOME A COMMUNICATION CENTRE,UP TO DATE AND OPEN TO OUTSIDE INFLUENCES. REGIONAL NEEDS SHOULD BE EMPHASISEDRATHER THAN NATIONAL STANDARDISATION. LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES SHOULD CONTAIN NEWFIELDS OF STUDY, LIKE SOCIAL AND COMMUNICATION SCIENCES. SOME FORMAL LECTURESSHOULD BE REPLACED BY SMALL STUDY GROUPS, EXAMINATION PROCEDURES SHOULD BEIMPROVED AND BETTER USE MADE OF PRACTICAL TRAINING PERIODS
