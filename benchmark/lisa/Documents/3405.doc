ERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS ON A COMPUTER INTERFACE TO AN INFORMATION RETRIEVALNETWORK.     A PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT WAS TO DEVELOP AN INTERFACE THAT WOULD PROVIDEDIRECT ACCESS FOR INEXPERIENCED USERS TO EXISTING ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHICINFORMATION RETRIEVAL NETWORKS. THE EXPERIMENT TESTED THE CONCEPT OF AVIRTUAL-SYSTEM MODE OF ACCESS TO A NETWORK OF HETEROGENEOUS INTERACTIVERETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DATA BASES. AN EXPERIMENTAL TRANSLATING COMPUTERINTERFACE NAMED CONIT WAS DEVELOPED AS A RESEARCH TEST VEHICLE. THE INTERFACEWAS DESIGNED TO MAKE THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF 3 DIFFERENT BIBLIOGRAPHICRETRIEVAL SYSTEMS EASY TO USE, EVEN BY INEXPERIENCED USERS, BY PROVIDING ASIMPLIFIED COMMON COMMAND LANGUAGE COUPLED WITH EXTENSIVE ON-LINE INSTRUCTION.REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS
