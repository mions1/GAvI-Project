HER WE MOVE OR ELSE WE STOP ACCEPTING MORE BOOKS.     DESCRIBES THE DEPOSIT LIBRARY AND ITS SPACE PROBLEMS. UNLESS THE LIBRARY MOVESFROM ITS PRESENT ACCOMMODATION IN THE BASEMENT OF THE LIBRARY SCHOOL WITHINHALF A YEAR, IT WILL HAVE TO START REFUSING BOOKS FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THELIBRARY'S PURPOSE IS TO STORE BOOKS WHICH HAVE BEEN CULLED FROM PUBLICLIBRARIES AND TO LEND OR GIVE THEM TO OTHER LIBRARIES, AND THEREFORE IT MUSTNECESSARILY GROW AT A TIME WHEN OTHER LIBRARIES CONTRACT. THE LIBRARY BEGAN IN1968 WITH 1400 SQ.M.; LATER A FURTHER 175 SQ.M. WERE ADDED FOR SHELVING AND1000 SQ.M. IN A WAREHOUSE ELSEWHERE. A SUITABLE BUILDING OF 7700 SQ.M. IS NOWAVAILABLE CHEAPLY. WITH AN INCREASE OF 25,000 VOLUMES A YEAR, THIS WOULDSECURE ENOUGH SPACE UNTIL THE 90S. RUNNING COSTS WILL BE 5.1 MILLION KR. IN 82AS COMPARED TO THE PRESENT 3.6 MILLION KR., AND COST OF ESTABLISHMENT WILL BE2.7 MILLION KR. THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OFLOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE LIBRAR Y COUNCIL HAVE NOW RECOMMENDED THAT THE MONEYSHOULD COME FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES' DISPOSITION FUND, NOT OTHERWISE USEDFOR SUCH PURPOSES, AS THE SOURCE OF THE LIBRARY'S FINANCE, THE PUBLICLIBRARIES' JOINT APPROPRIATION, WOULD BE UNABLE TO COPE. THE LIBRARY IS A LASTRESORT, AFTER THE CENTRAL LIBRARIES, FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE FOR THE LENDING OFOLDER BOOKS AND MEETS 55% OF ENQUIRIES, A FIGURE WHICH WOULD BE HIGHER IF ACATALOGUE OF HOLDINGS EXISTED
