IONAL NEEDS FOR CRITICALLY EVALUATED PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL DATA.     RELIABLE VALUES OF NUMERICAL DATA THAT EXPRESS IN QUANTITATIVE TERMS THEPROPERTIES AND BEHAVIOUR OF MATERIALS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ALL BRANCHES OF SCIENCEAND TECHNOLOGY AND ARE NEEDED TO ARRIVE AT VALID DECISIONS WHENEVER AGOVERNMENTAL OR INDUSTRIAL DECISION INVOLVES ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE ANDTECHNOLOGY. THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE CONTAINS MANY VALUABLE DATA COVERING AWIDE RANGE OF DIVERSE FIELDS. UNFORTUNATELY, IT ALSO CONTAINS MANY ERRONEOUSVALUES.

FOR THIS REASON, A NUMBER OFSPECIALISED DATA CENTRES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO COMPILE AND EVALUATE DATA INA SYSTEMATIC FASHION
