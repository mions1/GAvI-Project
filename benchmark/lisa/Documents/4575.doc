E MINISTER HAS BEEN LED ASTRAY.     THE CONTRIBUTION BY A MEMBER OF THE DANISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S EXECUTIVECOMMITTEE TO A DEBATE ON SCHOOL LIBRARIES HELD AT THE DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARYASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING, OCT 81. ARGUES THAT THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE INITS LIBRARY BILL HAS DISREGARDED THE LIBRARY COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS FOR SCHOOLLIBRARIES. ALTHOUGH RESEARCH LIBRARIES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE 1964 LIBRARYACT, A UNIFIED LIBRARY SYSTEM WAS BROUGHT ABOUT WITH THE INCLUSION OF SCHOOLLIBRARIES. THE IDEAL OF UNITY IS NOW BEING SET ASIDE. BUT IF THE SCHOOLLIBRARIES ARE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SCHOOLS, THE MINIMUM DEMAND TO ENSURETHEIR EXISTENCE MUST BE BY-LAWS GOVERNING THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO PUBLICLIBRARIES AND A SEPARATE BUDGET. THESE REQUIREMENTS WERE CONFIRMED BY THEMINISTER OF CULTURE. YET THE LIBRARY BILL MAKES NO MENTION OF THEM AND REDUCESTHE SEPARATE BUDGET TO AN ACCOUNTING ITEM IN THE LOCAL AUTHORITY FINANCES. THEBILL IS, THEREFORE, TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE TO THE DANISH LI BRARY ASSOCIATION
