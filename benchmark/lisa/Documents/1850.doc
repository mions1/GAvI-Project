INFECTION AND STRAIGHTENING OF PARCHMENT DAMAGED BY MICROORGANISMS.     BACTERIA AND MICELLAR FUNGI WERE ISOLATED FROM DAMAGED PARTS OF ANCIENTMANUSCRIPTS ON PARCHMENT AND INVESTIGATED. CATAMIN AB (ALREADY USED AS ADISINFECTANT FOR PAINTINGS) WAS FOUND TO BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ANTISEPTICAGENT AGAINST THESE PARCHMENT-DESTROYING MICROORGANISMS AND A DISINFECTINGTECHNIQUE INCORPORATING THE STRAIGHTENING OF DEFORMED PARCHMENTS WASDEVELOPED. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT CATAMIN AB HAS NO DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT ON THEPHYSICO-MECHANICAL AND PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF PARCHMENT
