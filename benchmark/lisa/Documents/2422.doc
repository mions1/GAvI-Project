ABASE COMMUNICATION IN A HETEROGENOUS DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM NETWORK.     AN ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH IS OUTLINED, TO FULFIL THE NEED FOR AN INTEGRATEDDATA BASE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ABLE TO SUPPORT ANY USER IN ANY NETWORK NODE,WITHOUT INCURRING MASS MIGRATION OF DATA. A GLOBAL QUERY TRANSLATOR PROCESSESQUERIES INTO A GLOBAL CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF INFORMATION CONTENT, AND A GLOBALINTERNAL MODEL OF DATA TO FORM AN ACCESS-PATH ORIENTED MODEL OF THE STRUCTUREOF THE INTEGRATED SYSTEM. SUB-QUERIES ARE FORMED USING A QUERY DECOMPOSER ANDACCESS PATH SELECTORS, AND ARE TRANSLATED INTO THE DATA BASE LANGUAGE. THEROLE OF LAYERS AND MAPPINGS IN THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE IS DEFINED BETWEENTHE VIRTUAL MODEL AND THE LOCAL PHYSICAL DATA BASE. THE ENTITY-RELATIONSHIPAND DIAM-SDDT MODELS ARE DESCRIBED AND COMPARED WITH GENERAL DATA BASEMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. AN EXAMPLE OF AN INTEGRATED NETWORK HETEROGENOUS DATA BASEIS FOLLOWED BY A DESCRIPTION OF INTER-DATA BASE RELATIONSHIPS IN THE UNIFIEDGLOBAL CONCEPTUAL MODEL
