LUATION OF AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM FOR ASSESSMENT OF TOXICOLOGICALEFFECTS OF CHEMICALS ON FISH, WILDLIFE AND ECOSYSTEM COMPONENTS.A USER-ORIENTED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM IS NEEDED FOR ASSESSMENT OFMATERIALS HAZARDOUS TO FISH, WILDLIFE, FOOD CHAIN ORGANISMS, AND OTHERORGANISMS ESSENTIAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES AND FUNCTIONS.CRITICAL EVALUATION OF DATA ALSO REQUIRES RIGOROUS DOCUMENTATION OF TESTCONDITIONS, PRECISION OF METHODS USED, AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TESTORGANISM. PARTICULAR EMPHASIS OF THE EVALUATION WAS IN DEVELOPING PRACTICALCRITERIA THAT AID IN THE USE AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA WITH RESPECT TO NEEDFOR FURTHER TESTING IN A SCORING EXERCISE PERFORMED FOR THE TOXIC SUBSTANCESCONTROL ACT INTERAGENCY TESTING COMMITTEE. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR THEINTEGRATION OF INFORMATION ON PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES, HEALTHEFFECTS, ECOTOXICOLOGY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCENTRATION OR EXPOSURE LEVEL
