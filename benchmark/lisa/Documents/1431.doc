CESSING OF PATENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH CHEMICAL PATENTINFORMATION SINCE IT BEGAN IN 1907. BY THE EARLY 1970S, ITS MANUAL DATAPROCESSING SYSTEM FOR PATENTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF STRAIN WITH A MILLIONRECORDS ALREADY AND 200,000 BEING ADDED ANNUALLY. TO CONVERT TO A COMPUTERISEDSYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE 25,000 MAN-HOURS IF EXISTING RECORDS WERE TO BE CONTAINEDIN THE NEW SYSTEM. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND IN 1977. ANAGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH INPADOC (THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATIONCENTRE) FOR INPADOC TO DELIVER TO CAS A BACK-FILE OF 1.2 MILLION PATENTRECORDS IN COMPUTER-READABLE FORM AND WEEKLY TAPES OF CURRENT PATENTBIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION.
