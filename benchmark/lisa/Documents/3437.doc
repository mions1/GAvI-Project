ATIVE IMPACT OF PRINT AND DATABASE PRODUCTS ON DATABASE PRODUCER EXPENSESAND INCOME-TRENDS FOR DATABASE PRODUCER ORGANIZATIONS BASED ON A THIRTEEN YEARFINANCIAL ANALYSIS.     A 13-YEAR ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCES OF A MAJOR DATA BASE PRODUCER ORGANISATION,WHICH IS ALSO A PUBLISHER OF ABSTRACTING AND INDEXING PRODUCTS, INDICATESTRENDS REGARDING THE IMPACT THAT BOTH PRINTED PRODUCTS AND DATA BASE PRODUCTSHAVE ON THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE ORGANISATION. THE QUESTION OF 'MIGRATION'(FROM PRINTED TO ON-LINE DATA BASE PRODUCTS) AND THE FACT THAT EXPENSES HAVEINCREASED MORE THAN INCOME ARE DISCUSSED AS THEY RELATE TO THE SURVIVAL ORGROWTH OF DATA BASE ORGANISATIONS. SINCE THE DATA BASE HAS GONE ON-LINE, THEREHAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE DATA BASE REVENUE, CONNECT HOURS, ANDNUMBERS OF ON-LINE USERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN DECREASES IN THENUMBER OF DATA BASE LEASES AND LICENCES, THE NUMBER OF PRINT PRODUCTSUBSCRIPTIONS, AND THE EXCESS OF INCOME OVER EXPENSES. IN CONSTA NT DOLLARS,THE COST OF PRODUCING AN ABSTRACT HAS DECREASED, THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGE FORPRINTED PRODUCTS HAS INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY, THE LEASE AND LICENSE FEES HAVEDECREASED, ROYALTY CHARGES HAVE INCREASED, AND HOURLY CONNECT FEES HAVEREMAINED STEADY (EVEN THOUGH THE SIZE OF THE ON-LINE FILE HAS INCREASEDGREATLY). THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MAINTAINING A BALANCED FINANCIAL STATUS INLIGHT OF INCREASED INCOME FROM ONE CLASS OF PRODUCTS, DECREASED INCOME FROMANOTHER CLASS OF PRODUCTS, AND INCREASED COST OF OPERATION. POSSIBLEAPPROACHES TO ENSURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY ARE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF EXPENSES,EFFICIENCY OF OPERATION, MARKETING, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PRICING. THE MOSTPROMISING APPROACHES LIE IN THE AREAS OF PRICING AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEWPRODUCTS AND SERVI CES. THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A CONSORTIUM OF DATABASE PRODUCERS FOR OFFERING ON-LINE SERVICES IS PROPOSED. THERE APPEARS TO BENO ALTERNATIVE TO INCREASING THE PRICES FOR ON-LINE USERS
