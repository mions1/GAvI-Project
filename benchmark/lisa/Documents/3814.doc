AUTOMATED SYSTEM OF SEMANTIC INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION.     THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTING AN AUTOMATED ADAPTIVE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ANDDISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BASED ON A SEMIOTIC MODEL ARE CONSIDERED. THIS MODELDERIVES FROM THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS THOSE UNDERLYING RELATIONAL LANGUAGES OFFACET AND BLOCK CLASSIFICATIONS. THE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS AND DISTRIBUTION OFDOCUMENTS, THE GENERAL TECHNOLOGICAL SCHEME OF THE SYSTEM, AND ALGORITHMS OFITS BASIC CIRCUIT ARE DESCRIBED. THE POSSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION OF ASEMIOTIC MODEL TO SDI IS DEMONSTRATED
