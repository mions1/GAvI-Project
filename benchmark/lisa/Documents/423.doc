ASSESSMENT OF CARCINOGENICITY OF N-NITROSO COMPOUNDS BY THE SIMCA METHOD OFPATTERN RECOGNITION.THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE TOXIC RESPONSES OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTALPOLLUTANTS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES HAS MANYADVANTAGES. PATTERN RECOGNITION METHODS CAN BE USED TO PREDICT SUCHPHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES. THE SIMCA METHOD OF PATTERN RECOGNITION IS USED TOPREDICT THE CARCINOGENICITY OF +N-NITROSO COMPOUNDS, AND THE ADVANTAGES OFTHIS METHOD OF PATTERN RECOGNITION IN SUCH APPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED
