PUTER-AIDED SELECTION OF COMPOUNDS FOR ANTITUMOR SCREENING' VALIDATION OF ASTATISTICAL-HEURISTIC METHOD.     RECENT WORK HELPED CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF A PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHEDSTATISTICAL-HEURISTIC METHOD FOR SELECTING COMPOUNDS TO BE PROCESSED IN THENATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI) MOUSE TUMOUR PRESCREEN. ONE STUDY INVOLVEDABOUT 35,000 COMPOUNDS WHICH SATISFIED CERTAIN BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICALCRITERIA. THESE COMPOUNDS, TAKEN FROM THE NCI COLLECTION, WERE RANKEDACCORDING TO PREDICTED PROBABILITY OF ACTIVITY. THE RESULTS SHOWED 34% OF THEACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN THE TOP 10% OF THE RANKING. IN A SECOND STUDY THEPREDICTIVE ABILITY OF A CHEMIST AND THE COMPUTER WERE COMPARED BY HAVING EACHRATE ALMOST 1,000 PREVIOUSLY UNSELECTED COMPOUNDS FOR ACTIVITY. THE RESULTSWERE ABOUT EQUAL WITH RESPECT TO THE YIELD OF BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS,THOUGH THEIR SELECTION AGREEMENT WAS FAIRLY LOW
