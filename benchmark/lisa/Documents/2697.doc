L THE STATE TAKE THE FINANCIAL BACKBONE OUT OF THE LIBRARY ACT?.     STATE GRANTS TO THE VEST-AGDER (NORWAY) COUNTY LIBRARY AMOUNTED IN 1980 TO 35%OF ITS BUDGET. RECENT PROPOSALS BY THE JUEL COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTREFORM WOULD MEAN THE WITHDRAWAL OF STATE SUPPORT. IF RESPONSIBILITY FORLIBRARY SERVICE DEVOLVES ENTIRELY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE NORWEGIAN PUBLICLIBRARY SYSTEM WILL BE THREATENED BY DISINTEGRATION, WITH NATIONAL LIBRARYDUTIES CONCENTRATED IN A FEW STATE-OWNED SPECIAL LIBRARIES.

UNDER THE NEW PROPOSALS, LIBRARIES IN THE MOST DEPRIVED AREAS WOULDBE IN MOST DANGER, AND CULTURAL ACTIVITY AS A WHOLE WOULD BE VULNERABLE TOPOLITICAL MOTIVATION
