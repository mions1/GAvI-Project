LICATION OF INFORMATION THEORY TO THE DESIGN OF LINE-SCAN IMAGING SYSTEMS.     INFORMATION THEORY IS USED TO FORMULATE A SINGLE FIGURE OF MERIT FOR ASSESSINGTHE PERFORMANCE OF LINE SCAN IMAGING SYSTEMS AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR SPATIALRESPONSE (POINT SPREAD FUNCTION OR MODULATION TRANSFER FUNCTION), SENSITIVITY,SAMPLING AND QUANTIZATION INTERVALS, AND THE STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF ARANDOM RADIANCE FIELD
