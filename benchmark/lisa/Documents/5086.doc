RIODICALS IN OUR LIBRARIES.PERIODICALS ARE VALUABLE IN EVERY LIBRARY SINCE THEY ARE TOPICAL MATERIAL ANDATTRACT NEW READERS WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE USE THE LIBRARY. PERIODICALSELECTION IS IMPORTANT; A LIST IS INCLUDED OF 42 GERMAN LANGUAGE PERIODICALSON ALL SUBJECTS, FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN, WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED SUITABLEFOR A ROMAN CATHOLIC PARISH LIBRARY. PERIODICAL SELECTION BY A TEAM ISESSENTIAL; THE TEAM COULD INCLUDE THE PRIEST, THE PARISH COUNCIL ANDREPRESENTATIVES FROM OTHER INTERESTED BODIES. SELECTION SHOULD TAKE PARTICULARCOMMUNITY INTERESTS INTO ACCOUNT BUT EXCESSIVE SPECIALISATION SHOULD BEAVOIDED. FINANCE IS ALWAYS A PROBLEM; SOME INDIVIDUAL READERS MIGHT BE WILLINGTO HELP. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUBLICISE THE LIBRARY'S PERIODICAL STOCKS
