LYING H.A. SIMON'S MODEL OF LIMITED RATIONALITY TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ANDCOMMUNICATION.     A GREAT NUMBER OF SPECIALIST AND NON-SPECIALIST QUESTIONS ARE ASKED ABOUTSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, CONCERNING OBJECTIVES, METHODS, RESULTS, ORGANISATION,POLICIES AND INFORMATION SOURCES. SUCH QUESTIONS CAN BE COLLECTED AND ANALYSEDFOR COMMON DENOMINATORS BUT RECENT WORK BY ANDREWS AND HIS COLLABORATORS(1979) INDICATES THIS APPROACH TO BE INADEQUATE. USES SIMON'S CONCEPT OFLIMITED RATIONALITY AS A GENERAL MODEL OF INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANISATIONALOPERATION, WHICH IS APPLIED AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATINGRESEARCH ACTIVITIES. THE MODEL DOES HELP IN EXPLANATION OF OBSERVATIONSFREQUENTLY MADE ABOUT RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS' PREFERENCE FOR INFORMALINFORMATION SOURCES AND PERSONAL CONTACTS, AND THE FORMATION OF INFORMALGROUPS AND NETWORKS. RESEARCHERS AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS WOULD APPEAR TOFUNCTION WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF LIMITED RATIONALITY. THIS MODEL CAN ALSO BEUSED TO PREDICT POTE NTIAL PROBLEMS IN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION, SUCH AS THECONCEPTION AND USE OF THESAURI AND DATA BANKS. THE QUALITY OF SUCH INFORMATIONSOURCES IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, HENCE THE IMPORTANCEOF UNDERSTANDING RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR
