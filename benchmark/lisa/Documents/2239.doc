ENTIFIC RESEARCH TECHNIQUES. THE USE OF 2SCIENCE CITATION INDEX1 TO STUDYTHE DISSEMINATION DYNAMICS OF AFFINE CHROMATOGRAPHY.     EXPLORES THE FEASIBILITY OF USING 2SCIENCE CITATION INDEX1 TO ANALYSE RESEARCHMETHOD TRANSFER DYNAMICS, USING THE EXAMPLE OF AFFINE CHROMATOGRAPHY. THEDISSEMINATION OF 2 VERSIONS OF THIS TECHNIQUE (DEVELOPED IN SWEDEN AND THEUSA) IS STUDIED; THE COMMUNICATION LINKS USED BY THE ORIGINATORS OF THEMETHODS ARE UNCOVERED; AND THE INFORMATION ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY THEORIGINATORS CONCERNING THEIR METHOD'S USE IN RESEARCH ARE DESCRIBED. SUCHSTUDIES COULD BE USED TO COMPARE THE TECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITY OF SCIENCE INDIFFERENT COUNTRIES
