ROFICHE AS A VEHICLE FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS.     THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE IS INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITY OFIMPROVING THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR INFORMATION DISSEMINATION PROGRAMMEBY MAKING A LARGER PART OF THE DISSEMINATION IN MICROFICHE INSTEAD OF PAPERCOPY. THEY COMMISSIONED THIS STUDY ON AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT TO HELP THEMDECIDE WHETHER MICROFICHE DISSEMINATION WOULD HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT. THEREPORT CONCLUDES THAT, AS PRESENTLY USED, MOST OF THE ADVANTAGES OF MICROFICHEACCRUE TO THE PRODUCER, AND MOST OF THE DISADVANTAGES TO THE USER. THERE ISLIKELY TO BE CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE TO BROADENING THE USE OF FICHE FOR THEINTENDED AUDIENCE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSIONALS. SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES AREPRESENTED FOR LESSENING THIS PROBLEM, INCLUDING EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OFLIBRARIES, PROMOTING THE AVAILABILITY OF FICHE-TO-PAPER COPIERS, AND USINGMICROFICHE ITSELF IN INNOVATIVE WAYS TO FACILITATE INFORMATION TRANSFER,RATHER THAN AS AN ATTEMPT TO DUPLICATE THE FEATURES O F A PAPER PUBLICATION INA REDUCED SIZE
