MPARISON OF RESULTS OBTAINED USING THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS DATA BASE INSEARCHES PERFORMED THROUGH DIALOG AND ESA-QUEST.REPORT OF RESEARCH CARRIED OUT AT THE SPANISH NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INFORMATIONAND DOCUMENTATION CENTRE (CENIDOC). IDENTICAL SEARCHES WERE PERFORMED THROUGHTHE DIALOG AND ESA-QUEST SYSTEMS, USING 2CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS1 (CA), FOR EQUALLENGTHS OF TIME. FULL DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE INITIAL RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS TOEXPLAIN PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN REFERENCES RETRIEVED, AND THECONSTRUCTION OF THE CA FILE. RESULTS OBTAINED USING A WIDE VARIETY OF SEARCHCRITERIA ARE PRESENTED. THE SYSTEMS AGREED ONLY WHEN REGISTRATION NUMBERS ORPERIODICAL CODES WERE USED, AND MORE INFORMATION WAS ALWAYS OBTAINED THROUGHDIALOG USING INDEXING TERMS. THE CONCLUSION REACHED IS THAT QUEST DOES NOT USETHE COMPLETE CA SEARCH, AND DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF ITS LIMITATIONS
