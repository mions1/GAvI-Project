 ARCHITECT'S VIEW OF MULTI-PURPOSE PLANS.     USING LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS FOR OTHER PURPOSES OUTSIDE OPENING HOURS IS ANATURAL AND GOOD CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR DEVELOPING LIAISON WITH OTHER CULTURALACTIVITIES. THE TRADITION OF CHARGING AT MOST A NOMINAL RENT IS LESSDEFENSIBLE. EXTRA USE INVOLVES UPKEEP AND STAFFING COSTS, AND ORGANISATIONSMAY RENT UNSUITABLE PREMISES FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. THE DISTRICT CENTRE ATLYNGEN, NORWAY, HOUSING A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISATIONS AND A POTENTIAL EXAMPLEOF INTEGRATED ACTIVITY, HAS TO CHARGE A RENT UNACCEPTABLE TO SMALLER GROUPS.FOR EFFECTIVE USE, ALL CULTURAL PREMISES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME FINANCIALSTANDING AND JOINT ADMINISTRATION. IN PLANNING OR CONVERSION, THE NEEDS OFINDIVIDUAL USERS SHOULD BE ANALYSED AND COORDINATED. THE LIBRARIAN, FORINSTANCE, SHOULD BE ABLE TO RENT CERTAIN AREAS FULL-TIME (E.G. THE NECESSARYSPACE FOR STORING EQUIPMENT, SHELVING AND BOOKS) AND OTHER AREAS FOR THELIBRARY'S ACTUAL OPENING HOURS, OUTSIDE WHICH THEY COULD BE USED  BY OTHERORGANISATIONS
