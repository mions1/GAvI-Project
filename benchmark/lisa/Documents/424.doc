ELOPMENT OF A FORMAT FOR ABSTRACTING DOSE-RESPONSE INFORMATION FROMPUBLISHED STUDIES FOR USE IN QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS(QSARS).THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT SUBJECTS SOME 70,000 CHEMICALS TO REGULATORYACTION. HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL TESTING OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF THIS NUMBEROF COMPOUNDS IS NOT FEASIBLE. AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OFPREDICTIVE METHODOLOGY WHICH CAN BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE POTENCY OF ANUNTESTED COMPOUND TOWARD A SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL RECEPTOR. PREREQUISITE TO SUCHAN ENTERPRISE IS THE HIGHLY SYSTEMATIC COMPILATION OF DOSE-RESPONSEINFORMATION FOR A WIDE RANGE OF BIOLOGICAL END POINTS AND FOR A WIDE VARIETYOF MOLECULAR SPECIES. A FORMAT IS DESCRIBED FOR ABSTRACTING RELEVANTINFORMATION FROM PUBLISHED STUDIES. THE FORMAT OUTLINES THE TEST SYSTEM,EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS, RESPONSE ANALYSIS, EXPOSURE PROTOCOL, AND RESULTS ANDPRESENTS THE ORIGINAL DATA, ALL IN AN ORGANISED FORM. REGRESSION ANALYSIS ISUSED TO ESTIMATE THRES HOLDS AND POTENCIES IN THE VARIOUS TEST SYSTEMS. THEDATA MAY THEN BE USED TO DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE METHODOLOGY
