E TEACHER AND THE MEDIA CENTRE-PROBLEMS AND DISTURBANCES IN USE.     THE FUNCTIONS AND ORGANISATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES/MEDIA CENTRES ASINDISPENSIBLE PREREQUISITES FOR THE REALISATION OF EDUCATIONAL AIMS HAVE BEENDISCUSSED SINCE THE 1970S, BUT LIBRARIANS' HIGH EXPECTATIONS HAVE GENERALLYNOT BEEN REALISED. EVEN IN COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS, MEDIA CENTRES ARE STILL ONLYON THE FRINGE OF SCHOOL LIFE. THE USE OF A MEDIA CENTRE AS A FOCAL POINT OFSCHOOL ACTIVITIES DEMANDS RADICAL CHANGES IN SCHOOL STRUCTURE AND THETEACHER'S ROLE. MANY OF THE MEDIA PROVIDED ARE UNSUITED TO THE SCHOOL LEARNINGSITUATION. TEACHERS HAVE TO SPEND MUCH TIME PLANNING THE DEVELOPMENT OFINDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMMES; CLOSE COOPERATION WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIANS WOULDPROVE HELPFUL HERE. ADMINISTRATION OF CENTRALLY STORED MEDIA IS EFFECTIVE ANDECONOMICAL BUT SINCE MUCH TIME IS WASTED WHEN CHILDREN MOVE BETWEEN CLASSROOMAND MEDIA CENTRE, FLEXIBLE TIMETABLES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED
