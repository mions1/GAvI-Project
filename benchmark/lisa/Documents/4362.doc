NER-LAMBERT/PARKE-DAVIS-CAS REGISTRY III INTEGRATED INFORMATION SYSTEM.     THE CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) REGISTRY III RECORDS OF CHEMICALSTRUCTURE ARE USED TO AUGMENT THE WARNER-LAMBERT/PARKE-DAVIS (WL/PD) COMPUTERFILES OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DATA. ENTRY OF DATA AT WL/PD IS PARALLELED BYENTRY OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES AND NAMES AT CAS, WHICH THEN SENDS THECOMPUTER-READABLE RECORDS TO WL/PD. WL/PD USES INQUIRE SOFTWARE WHICH PROVIDESINTERACTIVE OR BATCH MULTIFILE SEARCH CAPABILITIES AND ROUTINE REPORTGENERATION. BATCH PROCESSING IS USED FOR SUBSTRUCTURE SEARCHING ANDHIGH-QUALITY PRINTING OF STRUCTURES AND NAMES
