ROVING NASA'S TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROCESS THROUGH INCREASING SCREENING ANDEVALUATION IN THE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION PROGRAM.     THE CURRENT STATUS OF NASA'S TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER SYSTEM CAN BE IMPROVED IF THETECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROCESS IS BETTER UNDERSTOOD. THIS UNDERSTANDING WILL ONLYBE GAINED IF A DETAILED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT FACTORS GENERALLY INFLUENCINGTECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IS DEVELOPED, AND PARTICULARLY THOSE FACTORS AFFECTINGTECHNOLOGY TRANSFER FROM GOVERNMENT R AND D AGENCIES TO INDUSTRY. SECONDARYUTILISATION OF AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY IS MADE MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT DEPENDSON A TRANSFER PROCESS WHICH CROSSES ESTABLISHED ORGANISATIONAL LINES OFAUTHORITY AND WHICH IS OUTSIDE WELL UNDERSTOOD PATTERNS OF TECHNICALAPPLICATIONS.
