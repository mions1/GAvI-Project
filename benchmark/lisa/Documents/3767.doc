TUDY OF INFORMATION CHANNELS IN TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION' THEIR ROLE INTECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.     SUMMARY OF A BRAZILIAN DISSERTATION PRESENTED FOR A HIGHER DEGREE ININFORMATION SCIENCE, BASED CHIEFLY ON RECENT LITERATURE, BRAZILIAN ANDFOREIGN. THE STUDY COVERS THE PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION IN SCIENCE ANDTECHNOLOGY; USER CHARACTERISTICS; THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TECHNOLOGICALINNOVATION AND INFORMATION CHANNELS; AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND INFORMATIONCHANNELS. THIS ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESS LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT INRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LABORATORIES, INFORMAL CHANNELS OF TECHNICALCOMMUNICATION ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. PROPOSES WAYS IN WHICH RESEARCH ANDDEVELOPMENT MANAGERS CAN MAXIMISE USE OF HUMAN RESOURCES THROUGH MANIPULATIONOF THE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS WITHIN THE ORGANISATION, THROUGH INVESTIGATIONOF THE EXISTING COMMUNICATION/INFORMATION ROLES AS INFORMATION PROCESSINGSYSTEMS. THESE ROLES CONSTITUTE THE TRUE AGENTS OF TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION ,BOTH WITHIN THE ORGANISATION AND BETWEEN SEPARATE ORGANISATIONS. PARTICULARREFERENCE IS MADE TO RECENT BRAZILIAN RESEARCH
