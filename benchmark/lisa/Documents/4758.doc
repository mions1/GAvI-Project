ENT COVERAGE BY ABSTRACTING SERVICES. 4. COVERAGE OF MICROBIOLOGICALPATENTS.     REPORTS A STUDY ON THE COVERAGE BY 7 MAJOR ABSTRACTING SERVICES IN THE FIELDOF MICROBIOLOGY IN REGARD TO PATENTS. ONLY 3 OF THE SERVICES-2CHEMICALABSTRACTS, MICROBIOLOGY ABSTRACTS, SECTION +A, 1AND 2FOOD SCIENCE ANDTECHNOLOGY ABSTRACTS1-COVER PATENTS AT ALL. THE 3 SERVICES WERE ASSESSED INTERMS OF THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE ABOUT PATENTS AND IN TERMS OF THEIRPERFORMANCE IN RETRIEVING PATENTS TAKEN FROM A MASTER LIST OF PATENTS ONGENETIC ENGINEERING AND VITAMIN D, OBTAINED BY SEARCHES ON 2WORLD PATENTSINDEX. 1TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES WAS ALSO ASSESSED. IT WAS FOUND THAT NONEOF THE STANDARD ABSTRACTING SERVICES IN THE FIELD COVER PATENTS SATISFACTORILYAND THEY ARE SLOW IN PICKING UP PATENTS. THE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT BYSCANNING JUST JAPANESE, U.S.S.R. U.S., AND U.K. PATENTS, BOTH TIMELY ANDCOMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE MICROBIOLOGICAL PATENT LITERATURE CAN BEOBTAINED
