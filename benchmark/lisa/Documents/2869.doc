ERNATIVES FOR FUTURE LIBRARY CATALOGS' A COST MODEL' FINAL REPORT OF THELIBRARY CATALOG COST MODEL PROJECT PREPARED FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF RESEARCHLIBRARIES.     UNDER ARL SPONSORSHIP, KING RESEARCH, INC., DEVELOPED A LIBRARY CATALOG COSTMODEL TO ASSIST 72 PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES IN COMPARING THE COST OFALTERNATIVE FUTURE FORMS OF CATALOGUE, EMPHASISING THE COST OF IMPLEMENTINGAACR2. 68 LIBRARIES PREPARED INPUTS CHARACTERISING THEIR COSTS AND MODES OFOPERATION, AND THESE WERE USED, WITH THE MODEL, TO COMPUTE COSTS OFALTERNATIVE CATALOGUE FORMS. INPUTS AND OUTPUTS OF THE MODEL WERE HIGHLYVARIABLE. COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING AACR2 WERE ESTIMATED TO BE 4-7% OF THE TOTALCOST OF DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING A CATALOGUE. THE MODEL CAN BE A USEFULPLANNING, BUDGETING AND STAFFING TOOL, AND MAY BE SEEN AS A PROTOTYPE,ADAPTABLE TO PROJECT COSTS OF OTHER LIBRARY OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLYACQUISITIONS. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR FUTURE MODEL DEVELOPMENT
