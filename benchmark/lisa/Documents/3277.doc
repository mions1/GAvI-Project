CURRENTSTUDIES REVEAL THAT, ALTHOUGH AS CHILDREN REACH JUNIOR HIGH AGE THEY USE THEPUBLIC LIBRARY PREDOMINANTLY FOR SCHOOL PROJECTS, NEITHER SCHOOL NOR PUBLICLIBRARIES ARE IMPORTANT IN THE CHILD'S TOTAL PATTERN OF INFORMATION SEEKING.LACK OF TRANSPORTATION, TIME, AND SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS BASED ON LIBRARYRESOURCES CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PATTERN. WHILE MULTIPLE COOPERATIVES SUCH ASTHOSE DEVELOPING IN COLORADO AND BEING INITIATED IN NEW YORK ARE OF INTERESTAND SHOW PROMISE, LARGE-SCALE FAILURE TO DEVELOP INTER- AND INTRALIBRARY LOANPOLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHICH INCLUDE CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS AS USERSFURTHER INHIBIT ACCESS BY THE YOUNG.

IN FIGHTING THE BATTLE OFACCESS FOR THE YOUNG, LIBRARIANS MUST DEVELOP BROADER COMPETENCIES IN THEAREAS OF MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY
