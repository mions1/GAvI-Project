TE-OF-THE-ART REPORT ON STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY METHODS DEVELOPMENT.THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE THE AGENCY WITH THETECHNICAL BASIS FOR ESTIMATING THE TOXICITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOUR OFORGANIC CHEMICALS FROM MOLECULAR STRUCTURE. THE PROJECT IS DIRECTED TOWARD THEEVALUATION OF QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS (QSAR) FOR USE BYEPA PROGRAM OFFICES AND TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DATA AND QSAR METHODS TOEXTEND THE TECHNIQUE TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS. SPECIFICALLY, THE OBJECTIVE OF THESTRUCTURE-ACTIVITY PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP METHODS TO PREDICT THE TOXICITY,PERSISTENCE, AND TREATABILITY OF LARGE NUMBERS OF UNTESTED CHEMICALS USINGQSAR BASED ON STRUCTURAL, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OFREPRESENTATIVE REFERENCE DATA BASES
