ERMINATION OF THE CONSERVATION TIME OF PERIODICALS FOR OPTIMAL SHELFMAINTENANCE OF A LIBRARY.A METHOD BASED ON A CONSTRAINED OPTIMISATION TECHNIQUE IS PRESENTED TODETERMINE THE TIME OF REMOVAL OF SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS FROM THE SHELF OF ALIBRARY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MINIMISING SHELF MAINTENANCE COST ON THECONDITION THAT THE LOSS OF THE INFORMATION IS LESS THAN SOME SPECIFIED RATE.THE SOLUTION OBTAINED INDICATES THAT ALL THE UTILITIES OF THE PERIODICALSSHOULD BE EQUAL AT THE REMOVAL TIME. A GEOMETRICAL INTERPRETATION OF THETHEORETICAL RESULT IS GIVEN. A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE IS GIVEN TO SHOW HOW THISTECHNIQUE IS APPLICABLE TO REAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA
