MPANIA' ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARY SITUATION.     A COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING SERVICES IN A SOUTHERN ITALIAN REGIONBEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE IN NOV 80, SHOWING THE TOTAL INADEQUACY OF LIBRARYPROVISION, AND ABSENCE OF ANY OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVEINITIATIVES AND A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY TO DEVELOP SERVICES AND PROVIDETRAINING FOR LIBRARIANS. RELIABLE STATISTICS ARE UNAVAILABLE, BUT SUFFICIENTEVIDENCE IS PRESENTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BOTH IN NAPLES AND THROUGHOUT THEREGION, THE MAJORITY OF LIBRARIES ARE RESTRICTED TO UNIVERSITY USERS OR OTHERPRIVILEGED GROUPS, AND PUBLIC ACCESS TO READING IS EXTREMELY LIMITED. ANYACTIVITIES TO DEVELOP LIBRARY SERVICES HAVE BEEN ISOLATED INITIATIVES, WITHOUTRECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN THE COMMUNITY;EXPANSION IS HAPHAZARD AND THE CONCEPTS OF LIBRARY COOPERATION AND NETWORKPLANNING UTTERLY UNKNOWN. SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR THE CREATION OF REGIONALCENTRES AS A 1ST STEP IN AMELIORATING THE SITUATI ON. A NOTE CALLS ATTENTIONTO THE INCREASED URGENCY FOR ACTION FOLLOWING DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY BUILDINGSBY EARTHQUAKE, AND AN APPENDIX DEALS WITH THE PROBLEMS OF RESCUING ARCHIVESNOW AT RISK BECAUSE OF EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE
