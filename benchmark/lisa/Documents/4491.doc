HIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES, 1937 TO PRESENT.     FROM ALMOST ITS INCEPTION IN 1937, ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING HAS BEENPRIMARILY A POST-EMPLOYMENT EFFORT. THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INDIFFERENCE OFTHE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN BOTH THE FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND HISTORY,THE 2 MAIN DISCIPLINES FROM WHICH MANUSCRIPT LIBRARIANS AND ARCHIVISTS AREDRAWN. BETWEEN 1937-40 AND 1967-70, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BECAMEPERIPHERALLY INTERESTED. THE HISTORY PROFESSION HAS BECOME MORE ACTIVE SINCETHE EARLY 1970S IN ITS SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE CAREERS FOR ASPIRING HISTORIANS.INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY SCHOOLS ALSO HAVE BEEN OFFERING ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT COURSESSINCE THE EARLY 1960S PARTICULARLY. BY LACKING ACADEMIC STATUS, THE AMERICANLITERATURE IN THE ARCHIVAL FIELD HAS ALSO BEEN UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THIS HASCONTRIBUTED TO THE SLOWNESS IN DEVELOPING ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL CONTROL OFARCHIVAL/MANUSCRIPT SOURCES. AN ATTEMPT IN 1967-70 TO DEVELOP AN ARCHIVALMANUAL WITHI N A.L.A. DIED ABORNING AND THE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS ANDSOCIETY OF AMERICAN ARCHIVISTS HAVE JUST BEGUN TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEMINDEPENDENTLY. PRACTICING ARCHIVISTS OF NECESSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MAINTEACHER POOL AND CONTRIBUTORS TO THE LITERATURE UNTIL REGULAR FACULTY INLIBRARY SCHOOLS AND HISTORY DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY TRAINED, BUT 1STA BASIC REORIENTATION MUST OCCUR THAT RECOGNISES THAT RECORDS AND PAPERS OFCONTEMPORARY SOCIETY ARE THE CENTRAL PROBLEM
