ATION RATES TO TECHNOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT PATENTS.     THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE AVERAGE NUMBER OFCITATIONS RECEIVED BY ISSUED US PATENTS FROM SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED US PATENTS ISHIGHER FOR PATENTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAN FOR AGROUP OF RANDOMLY SELECTED PATENTS. ANALYSIS OF EXAMINERS' CITATIONS TO 100SELECTED PATENTS SHOWED THAT THESE SELECTED PATENTS, WHICH UNDERLAYTECHNICALLY IMPORTANT PRODUCTS, WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS FREQUENTLY CITED AS ARANDOMLY SELECTED SET OF 102 CONTROL PATENTS. THIS FINDING PROVIDES STRONGEVIDENCE FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PATENT CITATION DATA CAN BE USED INTECHNOLOGICAL INDICATORS DEVELOPMENT, AND IN TECHNOLOGICAL POLICY ANALYSIS,SINCE IT IMPLIES THAT THE LOCATION AND ANALYSIS OF GROUPS OF HIGHLY CITEDPATENTS CAN PROVIDE A VALID INDICATOR OF PATENT AREAS OF TECHNICAL IMPORTANCE
