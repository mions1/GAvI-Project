Seems that Lucene uses by default a combination of Boolean Model and Vector Space Model, as
said by this link 	

https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_7_0/core/org/apache/lucene/search/similarities/TFIDFSimilarity.html

"[...]Lucene combines Boolean model (BM) of Information Retrieval with Vector Space Model (VSM) of Information Retrieval - documents "approved" by BM are scored by VSM. 
In VSM, documents and queries are represented as weighted vectors in a multi-dimensional space, 
where each distinct index term is a dimension, and weights are Tf-idf values.[...] 
VSM score of document d for query q is the Cosine Similarity of the weighted query vectors V(q) and V(d) [...]"



For probabilistic model (BM25) see this link
